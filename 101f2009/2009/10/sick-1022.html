<p>I’m not feeling well and I won’t be at class today. I encourage
you all to meet without me. The handout from last time lays out
some of the main points from the paper by Watson, and provides an
obvious starting point for discussion.</p>
<p>I’ll post a reading assignment later today. I think we should
take a detour from the syllabus, and before considering personal
identity, consider some more general puzzles about identity.</p>
<p>For an overview of the first set of puzzles we will discuss,
puzzles of <em>material constitution</em>, you could have a look at
<a href=
"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/material-constitution/">Ryan
Wasserman’s entry in the Stanford Encyclopedia</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the four puzzles, as he describes them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Debtor’s Paradox</em>. The ancient playwright Epicharmus
tells the tale of a poor but resourceful debtor. When approached
for payment, the man responds with a riddle. If you add a pebble to
a collection of pebbles, you no longer have the same number. If you
add a length to a cubit, you no longer have the same measure. In
the same way, if you add a bit of matter to a portion of matter you
no longer have the same entity. Since man is nothing more than a
material object whose matter is constantly changing, we do not
survive from one moment to the next. The debtor concludes that he
is not the same person who incurred the debt, so he cannot be held
responsible for payment. The exasperated creditor then strikes the
debtor, who protests the abusive treatment. The creditor expresses
sympathy, but points out that he cannot be held accountable for the
assault. After all, material change has already taken place so, by
the debtor’s own one line of reasoning, the guilty party is no
longer present. The scene is intended to be comedic, but the
argument is no laughing matter. The man who incurred the debt was
constituted by one portion of matter, M1. The man who is approached
for payment is constituted by a distinct portion of matter, M2
(where M2 consists of M1, together with some new matter). If
constitution is identity, the debtor’s reasoning is sound: the man
who is approached for payment is not the man who incurred the debt.
More generally, the argument would show that it is impossible for
human persons to survive the addition of any new parts.</p>
<p><em>The Puzzle of Dion and Theon</em>. The Stoic philosopher
Chrysippus invites us to consider the case of Dion and Theon, where
Dion is a normal human being and Theon is a large part of Dion
consisting of everything but Dion’s right foot. Suppose now that
the right foot is removed. Theon obviously survives the operation,
for his parts remain completely unchanged. But in that case it
seems as if Dion does not survive the operation, for otherwise we
would have two people in the same place at the same time. Hence,
Dion does not survive the loss of his foot. More generally, the
argument would show that human persons cannot survive the loss of
any constituent parts. (A modern variation on the ancient puzzle,
due to Peter Geach 1962 by way of David Wiggins 1967, concerns
Tibbles and Tib, where Tibbles is a cat and Tib a cat-part
consisting of everything but Tibbles’s tail.)</p>
<p><em>The Ship of Theseus Puzzle</em>. The ancient historian
Plutarch recounts the story of the famous ship of Theseus, which
was displayed in Athens for many centuries. Over time, the ship’s
planks wore down and were gradually replaced. In the ancient world,
the ship became “a standing example among the philosophers, for the
logical question as to things that grow; one side holding that the
ship remained the same, and the other contending it was not the
same” (Clough 1859, p. 21). In the modern era, the case took on
added interest, owing to a twist from Thomas Hobbes. Suppose that a
custodian collects the original planks as they are removed from the
ship and later puts them back together in the original arrangement.
In this version of the story, we are left with two seafaring
vessels, one on display in Athens and one in the possession of the
custodian. But where is the famous Ship of Theseus? With the
museum! After all, ships and other artifacts can survive the
complete replacement of parts, provided that the change is
sufficiently gradual. With the custodian! After all, ships and
other artifacts can survive being disassembled and reassembled.
Thus, at the end of the story, the ship of Theseus is present in
two places at once. More generally, the argument suggests that it
is possible for one material object to exist in two places at the
same time. (We get an equally implausible result by working
backwards: There are clearly two ships at the end of the story.
Each of those ships was also around at the beginning of the story,
for the reasons just given. So, at the beginning of the story,
there were actually two ships of Theseus occupying the same place
at the same time, one of which would go on to the museum and one of
which would enter into the care of the custodian.)</p>
<p><em>The Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay</em>. Suppose that, on
Monday, a sculptor purchases an unformed lump of clay, which he
names ‘Lump’. Suppose further that, on Tuesday, the artist sculpts
the clay into the form of the biblical king David and names his
statue ‘David’. It is tempting to say that, in this case, there is
only one object in the sculptor’s hands—David just is Lump. But, on
reflection, this identification is problematic, since Lump and
David seem to differ in various respects. First, Lump and David
differ in their temporal properties: Lump existed on Monday, while
David did not. Second, they differ in their persistence conditions
(i.e., the conditions under which they would and would not continue
to exist): Lump could survive being squashed, David could not.
Third, they differ in kind: Lump is a mere lump of clay, while
David is a statue. More generally, we can say that Lump and David
differ in their non-categorical properties, where these include all
of the various ways that a thing was, will, would, could, or must
be. (Fine 2003 argues that Lump and David also differ in their
aesthetic properties, among other things.) But if Lump and David
differ in even one respect, they are not the same thing, for
Leibniz’s Law tells that, for any x and y, if x = y, then x and y
have all the same properties. Thus, it seems as if the sculptor
holds not one, but two, material objects in his hands: a statue and
a lump of clay. More generally, it is possible for two material
objects to exist in the same place at the same time.</p>
