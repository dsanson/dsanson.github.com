<p>You have a choice between the following three topics. Write on
one of them: no more than 1000 words; due November 10th in
class.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>On p. 217 of “Free Agency”, Gary Watson says</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>One job that Frankfurt wishes to do with the distinction between
lower and higher orders of desire is to give an account of the
sense in which some wants may be said to be be more truly the
agent’s own than others…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the bottom of p. 218 and top of 219, he says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What this difficulty shows that the notion of orders of desires
or volitions does not do the work Frankfurt wants it to do. It does
not tell us why or how a particular want can have, among all of a
person’s “desires,” the special property of being peculiarly his
“own.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explain what the difficulty is that Watson has described for
Frankfurt’s view, and assess whether or not it shows what Watson
says it shows. Explain how Watson’s view attempts to avoid this
difficulty and assess its success at doing so.</p>
<ol start="2" class="decimal">
<li>In “The Mystery of Metaphysical Freedom”, p. 460–61, Peter Van
Inwagen says</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>As Carl Ginet has said, our freedom can only be the freedom to
add to the actual past—for the past is unalterable; it is what we
<em>find ourselves with</em> in any situation in which we are
contemplating some course of action. […] And, unless we are bona
fide miracle workers, we can make only such additions to the actual
past as conform to the laws of nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In “Are We Free to Break the Laws?”, David Lewis argues that we
are, in a sense, free to break the laws, admits that this requires
a small miracle, but denies that it requires that we be miracle
workers. Explain Lewis’s view and how it allows him to answer Van
Inwagen’s challenge. Assess its plausibility.</p>
<ol start="3" class="decimal">
<li>According to Roderick Chisholm, freedom requires that agent
causation. Explain his view, being sure to explain what agent
causation is, how it differs from event causation, and how it
differs from the lack of causation. Assess the plausibility of the
view.</li>
