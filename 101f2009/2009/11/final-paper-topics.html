<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Your paper should be no more than 1000 words (roughly three
pages). It should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1 inch margins
on all sides (unless you choose to email the paper to me as a plain
text email message without formatting).</p>
<p>Papers will be accepted until <strong>Midnight, December
10th</strong> (Thursday of finals week). Hard copies can be placed
in my mailbox in the Philosophy Department Office (University Hall
350). Note that the Department Office usually closes at 5 pm. If
you choose to email your paper, please send it as a PDF file, RTF
file, or plain text. Include “H101 Final Paper” in the subject
line.</p>
<p>If you send it as plain text (my preference), just paste it in
to the body of your email message, rather than as a separate
attachment.</p>
<p>(Wanna try something new? If you want to indicate simple
formatting (bold, italics, section headers, numbered and unnumbered
lists, blockquotes) in plain text, use <a href=
"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#block">markdown</a>.
If you need superscripts, subscripts, and footnotes use <a href=
"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown-vsstandard-markdown">
pandoc’s extended markdown</a>. The rules are easy to learn and
easy to use. Text formatted in this way is easy to read as is and
it can easily be transformed into html, latex, pdf, rtf, odt, etc.
using free tools. It is a better way to write!)</p>
<h2 id="prompts">Prompts</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by the possibility of “fission” for
any account of personal identity and defend your preferred
solution. Along the way, you need to engage with either Parfit or
Lewis, either by comparing and contrasting your solution with their
solution and explaining why your solution is preferable, or by
considering an objection they raise to your solution and providing
your response. (If your preferred solution <em>is</em> Parfit’s
solution, then you will need to engage with Lewis; if it is Lewis’s
solution, you’ll need to engage with Parfit; if it is neither
Parfit’s nor Lewis’s solution, then you are free to engage with
either).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by Tibbles and Tibs and your preferred
solution. Along the way, you should engage with Wiggins, Burke, or
Chisholm. (See prompt 1 for ideas about how this engagement might
go.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by the Ship of Theseus, and your
preferred solution. Along the way, you should engage with Wiggins,
Burke, or Chisholm. (Again, see prompt 1 for ideas about how this
engagement might go.)</p>
