<p>It is time for you to evaluate me. These evaluations are
important: I use them to try to figure out how to do things better;
they also play a role in tenure and promotion decisions. (I’ll be
coming up for tenure in two years, so this looms large for me.) I
appreciate the time you spend doing this.</p>
<p>I’m told that you can access the rating form by visiting your
class schedule for this term and clicking the “Evaluation” button
next to our class. (I think that <a href=
"http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/scansurvey/sei/studentinstructions.html">
this page</a> should also get you where you need to go.)</p>
<p>I don’t have access to the online forms, and all the information
you provide is anonymous. I won’t get any feedback until after I’ve
turned in your grades.</p>
<p>There are 10 questions and a textbox for open-ended comments.
Those comments are especially helpful. In particular, I’m
interested to hear your thoughts about:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>class discussion: did you find it valuable? did it increase
your understanding of the material? where there things I could have
done (or not done) to improve it?</li>
<li>topics/readings: were the readings useful? did you enjoy the
topics? were there topics you’d have liked to cover which we did
not? topics we covered you’d just as well not have covered?</li>
<li>assignments: I’d like to know what you think both about
quantity and quality. Did the assignments push you in good ways to
better understand the material? Were they too hard? Were there
enough/too many assignments? (There were no exams, only papers: do
you think there should have been an exam or two, in addition to
papers?)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m told that once the SEI form is submitted, you can’t edit it
in any way. If you’ve already filled the form out but would like to
provide additional anonymous feedback, you can write something up
and give it to our department secretary, Michelle Brown (350
University Hall; brown.930@osu.edu). And, of course, I always
welcome non-anonymous feedback as well.</p>
<p>The online SEI forms are available until the last day of
classes, <strong>Friday, December 4</strong>. The deadline cannot
be extended, so please make sure you respond before finals
week.</p>

<p>Thanks, David</p>

<p>Your paper should be no more than 1000 words (roughly three
pages). It should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1 inch margins
on all sides (unless you choose to email the paper to me as a plain
text email message without formatting).</p>
<p>Papers will be accepted until <strong>Midnight, December
10th</strong> (Thursday of finals week). Hard copies can be placed
in my mailbox in the Philosophy Department Office (University Hall
350). Note that the Department Office usually closes at 5 pm. If
you choose to email your paper, please send it as a PDF file, RTF
file, or plain text. Include “H101 Final Paper” in the subject
line.</p>
<p>If you send it as plain text (my preference), just paste it in
to the body of your email message, rather than as a separate
attachment.</p>
<p>(Wanna try something new? If you want to indicate simple
formatting (bold, italics, section headers, numbered and unnumbered
lists, blockquotes) in plain text, use <a href=
"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#block">markdown</a>.
If you need superscripts, subscripts, and footnotes use <a href=
"http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown-vsstandard-markdown">
pandoc’s extended markdown</a>. The rules are easy to learn and
easy to use. Text formatted in this way is easy to read as is and
it can easily be transformed into html, latex, pdf, rtf, odt, etc.
using free tools. It is a better way to write!)</p>
<h2 id="prompts">Prompts</h2>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by the possibility of “fission” for
any account of personal identity and defend your preferred
solution. Along the way, you need to engage with either Parfit or
Lewis, either by comparing and contrasting your solution with their
solution and explaining why your solution is preferable, or by
considering an objection they raise to your solution and providing
your response. (If your preferred solution <em>is</em> Parfit’s
solution, then you will need to engage with Lewis; if it is Lewis’s
solution, you’ll need to engage with Parfit; if it is neither
Parfit’s nor Lewis’s solution, then you are free to engage with
either).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by Tibbles and Tibs and your preferred
solution. Along the way, you should engage with Wiggins, Burke, or
Chisholm. (See prompt 1 for ideas about how this engagement might
go.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lay out the problem posed by the Ship of Theseus, and your
preferred solution. Along the way, you should engage with Wiggins,
Burke, or Chisholm. (Again, see prompt 1 for ideas about how this
engagement might go.)</p>
