                    <p>It is time for you to evaluate me. These
                    evaluations are important: I use them to try to
                    figure out how to do things better; they also
                    play a role in tenure and promotion decisions.
                    (I’ll be coming up for tenure in two years, so
                    this looms large for me.) I appreciate the time
                    you spend doing this.</p>

                    <p>I’m told that you can access the rating form
                    by visiting your class schedule for this term
                    and clicking the “Evaluation” button next to
                    our class. (I think that <a href=
                    "http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/scansurvey/sei/studentinstructions.html">
                    this page</a> should also get you where you
                    need to go.)</p>

                    <p>I don’t have access to the online forms, and
                    all the information you provide is anonymous. I
                    won’t get any feedback until after I’ve turned
                    in your grades.</p>

                    <p>There are 10 questions and a textbox for
                    open-ended comments. Those comments are
                    especially helpful. In particular, I’m
                    interested to hear your thoughts about:</p>

                    <ol class="decimal">
                      <li>class discussion: did you find it
                      valuable? did it increase your understanding
                      of the material? where there things I could
                      have done (or not done) to improve it?</li>

                      <li>topics/readings: were the readings
                      useful? did you enjoy the topics? were there
                      topics you’d have liked to cover which we did
                      not? topics we covered you’d just as well not
                      have covered?</li>

                      <li>assignments: I’d like to know what you
                      think both about quantity and quality. Did
                      the assignments push you in good ways to
                      better understand the material? Were they too
                      hard? Were there enough/too many assignments?
                      (There were no exams, only papers: do you
                      think there should have been an exam or two,
                      in addition to papers?)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>I’m told that once the SEI form is
                    submitted, you can’t edit it in any way. If
                    you’ve already filled the form out but would
                    like to provide additional anonymous feedback,
                    you can write something up and give it to our
                    department secretary, Michelle Brown (350
                    University Hall; brown.930@osu.edu). And, of
                    course, I always welcome non-anonymous feedback
                    as well.</p>

                    <p>The online SEI forms are available until the
                    last day of classes, <strong>Friday, December
                    4</strong>. The deadline cannot be extended, so
                    please make sure you respond before finals
                    week.</p>

                    <p>Your paper should be no more than 1000 words
                    (roughly three pages). It should be
                    double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1 inch margins
                    on all sides (unless you choose to email the
                    paper to me as a plain text email message
                    without formatting).</p>

                    <p>Papers will be accepted until
                    <strong>Midnight, December 10th</strong>
                    (Thursday of finals week). Hard copies can be
                    placed in my mailbox in the Philosophy
                    Department Office (University Hall 350). Note
                    that the Department Office usually closes at 5
                    pm. If you choose to email your paper, please
                    send it as a PDF file, RTF file, or plain text.
                    Include “H101 Final Paper” in the subject
                    line.</p>

                    <p>If you send it as plain text (my
                    preference), just paste it in to the body of
                    your email message, rather than as a separate
                    attachment.</p>

                    <p>(Wanna try something new? If you want to
                    indicate simple formatting (bold, italics,
                    section headers, numbered and unnumbered lists,
                    blockquotes) in plain text, use <a href=

                      <li>On p. 217 of “Free Agency”, Gary Watson
                      says</li>
                    </ol>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>One job that Frankfurt wishes to do with
                      the distinction between lower and higher
                      orders of desire is to give an account of the
                      sense in which some wants may be said to be
                      be more truly the agent’s own than
                      others…</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>On the bottom of p. 218 and top of 219, he
                    says</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>What this difficulty shows that the notion
                      of orders of desires or volitions does not do
                      the work Frankfurt wants it to do. It does
                      not tell us why or how a particular want can
                      have, among all of a person’s “desires,” the
                      special property of being peculiarly his
                      “own.”</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Explain what the difficulty is that Watson
                    has described for Frankfurt’s view, and assess
                    whether or not it shows what Watson says it
                    shows. Explain how Watson’s view attempts to
                    avoid this difficulty and assess its success at
                    doing so.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>As Carl Ginet has said, our freedom can
                      only be the freedom to add to the actual
                      past—for the past is unalterable; it is what
                      we <em>find ourselves with</em> in any
                      situation in which we are contemplating some
                      course of action. […] And, unless we are bona

                    <p>In “Are We Free to Break the Laws?”, David

                    break the laws, admits that this requires a
                    small miracle, but denies that it requires that
                    we be miracle workers. Explain Lewis’s view and

                    today. I encourage you all to meet without me.
                    The handout from last time lays out some of the
                    main points from the paper by Watson, and
                    provides an obvious starting point for
                    discussion.</p>

                    <p>I’ll post a reading assignment later today.
                    I think we should take a detour from the
                    syllabus, and before considering personal
                    identity, consider some more general puzzles
                    about identity.</p>

                    <p>For an overview of the first set of puzzles
                    we will discuss, puzzles of <em>material
                    constitution</em>, you could have a look at
                    <a href=
                    "http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/material-constitution/">
                    Ryan Wasserman’s entry in the Stanford
                    Encyclopedia</a>.</p>

                    <p>Here are the four puzzles, as he describes
                    them:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>The Debtor’s Paradox</em>. The ancient
                      playwright Epicharmus tells the tale of a
                      poor but resourceful debtor. When approached
                      for payment, the man responds with a riddle.
                      If you add a pebble to a collection of
                      pebbles, you no longer have the same number.
                      If you add a length to a cubit, you no longer
                      have the same measure. In the same way, if
                      you add a bit of matter to a portion of
                      matter you no longer have the same entity.
                      Since man is nothing more than a material
                      object whose matter is constantly changing,
                      we do not survive from one moment to the
                      next. The debtor concludes that he is not the
                      same person who incurred the debt, so he
                      cannot be held responsible for payment. The
                      exasperated creditor then strikes the debtor,
                      who protests the abusive treatment. The
                      creditor expresses sympathy, but points out
                      that he cannot be held accountable for the
                      assault. After all, material change has
                      already taken place so, by the debtor’s own
                      one line of reasoning, the guilty party is no
                      longer present. The scene is intended to be
                      comedic, but the argument is no laughing
                      matter. The man who incurred the debt was
                      constituted by one portion of matter, M1. The
                      man who is approached for payment is
                      constituted by a distinct portion of matter,
                      M2 (where M2 consists of M1, together with
                      some new matter). If constitution is
                      identity, the debtor’s reasoning is sound:
                      the man who is approached for payment is not
                      the man who incurred the debt. More
                      generally, the argument would show that it is
                      impossible for human persons to survive the
                      addition of any new parts.</p>

                      <p><em>The Puzzle of Dion and Theon</em>. The
                      Stoic philosopher Chrysippus invites us to
                      consider the case of Dion and Theon, where
                      Dion is a normal human being and Theon is a
                      large part of Dion consisting of everything
                      but Dion’s right foot. Suppose now that the
                      right foot is removed. Theon obviously
                      survives the operation, for his parts remain
                      completely unchanged. But in that case it
                      seems as if Dion does not survive the
                      operation, for otherwise we would have two
                      people in the same place at the same time.
                      Hence, Dion does not survive the loss of his
                      foot. More generally, the argument would show
                      that human persons cannot survive the loss of
                      any constituent parts. (A modern variation on
                      the ancient puzzle, due to Peter Geach 1962
                      by way of David Wiggins 1967, concerns
                      Tibbles and Tib, where Tibbles is a cat and
                      Tib a cat-part consisting of everything but
                      Tibbles’s tail.)</p>

                      <p><em>The Ship of Theseus Puzzle</em>. The
                      ancient historian Plutarch recounts the story
                      of the famous ship of Theseus, which was
                      displayed in Athens for many centuries. Over
                      time, the ship’s planks wore down and were
                      gradually replaced. In the ancient world, the
                      ship became “a standing example among the
                      philosophers, for the logical question as to
                      things that grow; one side holding that the
                      ship remained the same, and the other
                      contending it was not the same” (Clough 1859,
                      p. 21). In the modern era, the case took on
                      added interest, owing to a twist from Thomas
                      Hobbes. Suppose that a custodian collects the
                      original planks as they are removed from the
                      ship and later puts them back together in the
                      original arrangement. In this version of the
                      story, we are left with two seafaring
                      vessels, one on display in Athens and one in
                      the possession of the custodian. But where is
                      the famous Ship of Theseus? With the museum!
                      After all, ships and other artifacts can
                      survive the complete replacement of parts,
                      provided that the change is sufficiently
                      gradual. With the custodian! After all, ships
                      and other artifacts can survive being
                      disassembled and reassembled. Thus, at the
                      end of the story, the ship of Theseus is
                      present in two places at once. More
                      generally, the argument suggests that it is
                      possible for one material object to exist in
                      two places at the same time. (We get an
                      equally implausible result by working
                      backwards: There are clearly two ships at the
                      end of the story. Each of those ships was
                      also around at the beginning of the story,
                      for the reasons just given. So, at the
                      beginning of the story, there were actually
                      two ships of Theseus occupying the same place
                      at the same time, one of which would go on to
                      the museum and one of which would enter into
                      the care of the custodian.)</p>

                      <p><em>The Puzzle of the Statue and the
                      Clay</em>. Suppose that, on Monday, a
                      sculptor purchases an unformed lump of clay,
                      which he names ‘Lump’. Suppose further that,
                      on Tuesday, the artist sculpts the clay into
                      the form of the biblical king David and names
                      his statue ‘David’. It is tempting to say
                      that, in this case, there is only one object
                      in the sculptor’s hands—David just is Lump.
                      But, on reflection, this identification is
                      problematic, since Lump and David seem to
                      differ in various respects. First, Lump and
                      David differ in their temporal properties:
                      Lump existed on Monday, while David did not.
                      Second, they differ in their persistence
                      conditions (i.e., the conditions under which
                      they would and would not continue to exist):
                      Lump could survive being squashed, David
                      could not. Third, they differ in kind: Lump
                      is a mere lump of clay, while David is a
                      statue. More generally, we can say that Lump
                      and David differ in their non-categorical
                      properties, where these include all of the
                      various ways that a thing was, will, would,
                      could, or must be. (Fine 2003 argues that
                      Lump and David also differ in their aesthetic
                      properties, among other things.) But if Lump
                      and David differ in even one respect, they
                      are not the same thing, for Leibniz’s Law
                      tells that, for any x and y, if x = y, then x
                      and y have all the same properties. Thus, it
                      seems as if the sculptor holds not one, but
                      two, material objects in his hands: a statue
                      and a lump of clay. More generally, it is
                      possible for two material objects to exist in
                      the same place at the same time.</p>

                      contains both “The Consequence Argument” and
                      “The Mystery of Metaphysical Freedom”. We
                      will read both, but for next time, I want you
                      to focus on the first, shorter, piece.)</li>

                    <p>For your writing exercise, due in class next
                    Tuesday, I’d like you to, in 330 words or less,
                    present the Consequence Argument in its
                    strongest and clearest form, clearly indicating
                    the role played by what van Inwagen calls the
                    “Conditional Rule”. Finally, briefly indicate
                    what you take to be the strongest possible
                    criticism of the argument.</p>

                    <p>This exercise will not be pass/fail. It will
                    be graded.</p>
