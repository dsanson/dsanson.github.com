                    Description</h1>

                    <p>In this course, we will try to think clearly
                    and precisely about three difficult and thorny
                    philosophical issues: (1) What gives our lives
                    meaning? (2) Do we have free will? (3) What
                    constitutes a person’s identity over time?</p>

                    <h1 id="texts">Texts</h1>

                    <p>All readings will be made available through
                    the course webpage.</p>

                    <h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>

                    <p>Your grade will be based upon active
                    participation in class discussions (20%)
                    and</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>weekly one page exercises (20%
                      total);</li>

                      <li>two 4 to 5 page papers (30% each), due on
                      October 27th and December 7th (Monday of
                      finals week).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There will be no final exam.</p>

                    <h1 id="about-email">About Email</h1>

                    <p>Email is the best way to reach me. However,
                    I am not always online. Please allow me 48
                    hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48
                    hours please email me again, letting me know it
                    is your second email (I won’t take this as
                    harassment). Always include “Philosophy H101”
                    or “PhilH101” in the subject line of your
                    email.</p>

                    <h1 id="academic-misconduct">Academic
                    Misconduct</h1>

                    <p>You are strongly encouraged to discuss the
                    course material with your peers—philosophical
                    conversation is one of the best ways to get
                    better at doing philosophy. But your papers
                    must be your own work, and all sources must be
                    cited. I will report offenders to the committee
                    on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can
                    take on many forms: if you are confused, or
                    need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you
                    have not already, take a look at <a href=

                    contact me <strong>now</strong> to discuss your
                    needs. I will work with the Office for
                    Disability Services to coordinate reasonable
                    accommodations for any student with a
                    documented disability. Office for Disability
