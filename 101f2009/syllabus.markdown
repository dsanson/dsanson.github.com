# Course Description

In this course, we will try to think clearly and precisely about three
difficult and thorny philosophical issues: (1) What gives our lives
meaning? (2) Do we have free will? (3) What constitutes a person’s
identity over time?

# Texts

All readings will be made available through the course webpage.

# Requirements

Your grade will be based upon active participation in class discussions
(20%) and

-   weekly one page exercises (20% total);
-   two 4 to 5 page papers (30% each), due on October 27th and December
    7th (Monday of finals week).

There will be no final exam.

# About Email

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online.
Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours
please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won’t
take this as harassment). Always include “Philosophy H101” or “PhilH101”
in the subject line of your email.

# Academic Misconduct

You are strongly encouraged to discuss the course material with your
peers—philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better
at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all
sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on
academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you
are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not
already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

# Disabilities

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a
disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will
work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for any student with a documented disability. Office for
Disability Services, 150 Pomerene Hall, 292–3307.
