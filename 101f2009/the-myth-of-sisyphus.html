                    <p>Camus, A., 1955, “The Myth of Sisyphus”,
                    chapter 4 of his <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>,
                    J. O’Brien (tr.), London: H. Hamilton.</p>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The gods had condemned Sisyphus to
                    ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a
                    mountain, whence the stone would fall back of
                    its own weight. They had thought with some
                    reason that there is no more dreadful
                    punishment than futile and hopeless labor.</p>

                    <p>If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the
                    wisest and most prudent of mortals. According
                    to another tradition, however, he was disposed
                    to practice the profession of highwayman. I see
                    no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to
                    the reasons why he became the futile laborer of
                    the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of
                    a certain levity in regard to the gods. He
                    stole their secrets. Egina, the daughter of
                    Esopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father
                    was shocked by that disappearance and
                    complained to Sisyphus. He, who knew of the
                    abduction, offered to tell about it on
                    condition that Esopus would give water to the
                    citadel of Corinth. To the celestial
                    thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of
                    water. He was punished for this in the
                    underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus
                    had put Death in chains. Pluto could not endure
                    the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He
                    dispatched the god of war, who liberated Death
                    from the hands of her conqueror.</p>

                    <p>It is said that Sisyphus, being near to
                    death, rashly wanted to test his wife’s love.
                    He ordered her to cast his unburied body into
                    the middle of the public square. Sisyphus woke
                    up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an
                    obedience so contrary to human love, he
                    obtained from Pluto permission to return to
                    earth in order to chastise his wife. But when
                    he had seen again the face of this world,
                    enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea,
                    he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal
                    darkness. Recalls, signs of anger, warnings
                    were of no avail. Many years more he lived
                    facing the curve of the gulf, the sparkling
                    sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the
                    gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized the
                    impudent man by the collar and, snatching him
                    from his joys, lead him forcibly back to the
                    underworld, where his rock was ready for
                    him.</p>

                    <p>You have already grasped that Sisyphus is
                    the absurd hero. He is, as much through his
                    passions as through his torture. His scorn of
                    the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion
                    for life won him that unspeakable penalty in
                    which the whole being is exerted toward
                    accomplishing nothing. This is the price that
                    must be paid for the passions of this earth.
                    Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the
                    underworld. Myths are made for the imagination
                    to breathe life into them. As for this myth,
                    one sees merely the whole effort of a body
                    straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it,
                    and push it up a slope a hundred times over;
                    one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight
                    against the stone, the shoulder bracing the
                    clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the
                    fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly
                    human security of two earth-clotted hands. At
                    the very end of his long effort measured by
                    skyless space and time without depth, the
                    purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the
                    stone rush down in a few moments toward that
                    lower world whence he will have to push it up
                    again toward the summit. He goes back down to
                    the plain.</p>

                    <p>It is during that return, that pause, that
                    Sisyphus interests me. A face that toils so
                    close to stones is already stone itself! I see
                    that man going back down with a heavy yet
                    measured step toward the torment of which he
                    will never know the end. That hour like a
                    breathing-space which returns as surely as his
                    suffering, that is the hour of consciousness.
                    At each of those moments when he leaves the
                    heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of
                    the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is
                    stronger than his rock.</p>

                    <p>If this myth is tragic, that is because its
                    hero is conscious. Where would his torture be,
                    indeed, if at every step the hope of succeeding
                    upheld him? The workman of today works everyday
                    in his life at the same tasks, and his fate is
                    no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the
                    rare moments when it becomes conscious.
                    Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless
                    and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his
                    wretched condition: it is what he thinks of
                    during his descent. The lucidity that was to
                    constitute his torture at the same time crowns
                    his victory. There is no fate that can not be
                    surmounted by scorn.</p>

                    <p>If the descent is thus sometimes performed
                    in sorrow, it can also take place in joy. This
                    word is not too much. Again I fancy Sisyphus
                    returning toward his rock, and the sorrow was
                    in the beginning. When the images of earth
                    cling too tightly to memory, when the call of
                    happiness becomes too insistent, it happens
                    that melancholy arises in man’s heart: this is
                    the rock’s victory, this is the rock itself.
                    The boundless grief is too heavy to bear. These
                    are our nights of Gethsemane. But crushing
                    truths perish from being acknowledged. Thus,
                    Edipus at the outset obeys fate without knowing
                    it. But from the moment he knows, his tragedy
                    begins. Yet at the same moment, blind and
                    desperate, he realizes that the only bond
                    linking him to the world is the cool hand of a
                    girl. Then a tremendous remark rings out:
                    “Despite so many ordeals, my advanced age and
                    the nobility of my soul make me conclude that
                    all is well.” Sophocles’ Edipus, like
                    Dostoevsky’s Kirilov, thus gives the recipe for
                    the absurd victory. Ancient wisdom confirms
                    modern heroism.</p>

                    <p>One does not discover the absurd without
                    being tempted to write a manual of happiness.
                    “What!—-by such narrow ways—?” There is but one
                    world, however. Happiness and the absurd are
                    two sons of the same earth. They are
                    inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that
                    happiness necessarily springs from the absurd.
                    discovery. It happens as well that the felling
                    of the absurd springs from happiness. “I
                    conclude that all is well,” says Edipus, and
                    that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild
                    and limited universe of man. It teaches that
                    all is not, has not been, exhausted. It drives
                    out of this world a god who had come into it
                    with dissatisfaction and a preference for
                    futile suffering. It makes of fate a human
                    matter, which must be settled among men.</p>

                    <p>All Sisyphus’ silent joy is contained
                    therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a
                    thing Likewise, the absurd man, when he
                    contemplates his torment, silences all the
                    idols. In the universe suddenly restored to its
                    silence, the myriad wondering little voices of
                    the earth rise up. Unconscious, secret calls,
                    invitations from all the faces, they are the
                    necessary reverse and price of victory. There
                    is no sun without shadow, and it is essential
                    to know the night. The absurd man says yes and
                    his efforts will henceforth be unceasing. If
                    there is a personal fate, there is no higher
                    destiny, or at least there is, but one which he
                    concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the
                    rest, he knows himself to be the master of his
                    days. At that subtle moment when man glances
                    backward over his life, Sisyphus returning
                    toward his rock, in that slight pivoting he
                    contemplates that series of unrelated actions
                    which become his fate, created by him, combined
                    under his memory’s eye and soon sealed by his
                    death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human
                    origin of all that is human, a blind man eager
                    to see who knows that the night has no end, he
                    is still on the go. The rock is still
                    rolling.</p>

                    <p>I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the
                    mountain! One always finds one’s burden again.
                    But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that
                    negates the gods and raises rocks. He too
                    concludes that all is well. This universe
                    henceforth without a master seems to him
                    neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that
                    stone, each mineral flake of that night filled
                    mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle
                    itself toward the heights is enough to fill a
                    man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus
                    happy.</p>
