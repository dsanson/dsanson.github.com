This is a course in symbolic logic up to and including predicate logic with identity. The focus of the course is practical rather than metatheoretic, though you will be exposed to the metatheoretic concepts of soundness and completeness. In addition to becoming comfortable with the basic notions of logic--truth values, arguments, soundness, validity--you will learn how to symbolize sentences in both sentential logic and predicate logic, how to construct derivations, and how to use truth-tables.
