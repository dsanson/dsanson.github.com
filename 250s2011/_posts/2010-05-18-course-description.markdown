This course introduces symbolic logic up to and including predicate logic with identity. In addition to becoming comfortable with the basic notions of logic--truth, argument, soundness, validity--you will learn how to symbolize sentences in both sentential logic and predicate logic, how to construct derivations, and how to use truth-tables. Along the way, you will be exposed to some important metatheoretic concepts, including soundness and completeness.
