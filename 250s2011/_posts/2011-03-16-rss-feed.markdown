FYI, this site has an [RSS feed](atom.xml), which makes it easy to keep track of new posts without having to remember to visit the site.

You can subscribe to it in a newsreader like [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com). Or you can use a service like [FeedMyInbox](http://www.feedmyinbox.com/) to have new posts delivered via email.
