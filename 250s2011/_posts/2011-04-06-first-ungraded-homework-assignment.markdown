This is an **UNGRADED** homework assignment, due **IN RECITATION** on Tuesday, April 12th. The exercises are mostly *unstarred* exercises. You can check  answers against the student solutions guide.

I should also say that I *recommend* that you complete **ALL** unstarred exercises, even if I have not assigned them. You will do best in this course by devoting as much time as you possibly can to practicing.
