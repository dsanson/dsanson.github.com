excerpt: Here are some more SD derivations to practice on.
---

I suspect many of you have attempted every SD derivation in the book. 

Here are some more to try. These are taken from chapter 6 of P.D. Magnus's open-source logic textbook, "[Forall *x*](http://www.fecundity.com/logic/)." The system in that book is very close to our system, with a few notational differences. I've put the problems into the notation used by our book. I haven't checked these against the exercises in our book: there may be duplicates. 

1. K & L, ⊢ K ≡ L 
2. {A ⊃ (B ⊃ C)} ⊢ (A & B) ⊃ C 
3. {P & (Q ∨ R), P ⊃ ∼R} ⊢ Q ∨ E 
4. {(C & D) ∨ E} ⊢ E ∨ D 
5. {∼F ⊃ G, F ⊃ H} ⊢ G ∨ H 
6. {(X & Y) ∨ (X & Z), ∼(X & D), D ∨ M} ⊢ M
1. {Q ⊃ (Q & ∼Q)} ⊢ ∼Q 
2. {J ⊃ ∼J} ⊢ ∼J 
3. {E ∨ F, F ∨ G, ∼F} ⊢ E & G
4. {A ≡ B, B ≡ C} ⊢ A ≡ C 
5. {M ∨ (N ⊃ M)} ⊢ ∼M ⊃ ∼N 
6. {S ≡ T} ⊢ S ≡ (T ∨ S) 
7. {(M ∨ N) & (O ∨ P),N ⊃ P, ∼P} ⊢ M & O 
8. {(Z & K) ∨ (K & M), K ⊃ D} ⊢ D
1. ⊢ O ⊃ O 
2. ⊢ N ∨ ∼N 
3. ⊢ ∼(P & ∼ P ) 
4. ⊢ ∼(A ⊃ ∼C) ⊃ (A ⊃ C) 
5. ⊢ J ≡ [J ∨ (L & ∼ L)]

Show the following pairs of sentences are Equivalent in SD (i.e., show that the one can be derived from the other and the other from the one).

1. ∼∼∼∼ G, G 
2. T ⊃ S, ∼ S ⊃∼ T 
3. R ≡ E, E ≡ R 
4. ∼G≡H,∼(G≡H) 
5. U ⊃ I, ∼ (U & ∼ I)

More derivations

1. M & (∼N ⊃ ∼M) ⊢ (N & M) ∨ ∼M 
2. {C ⊃ (E & G), ∼C ⊃ G} ⊢ G 
3. {(Z & K) ≡ (Y & M), D & (D ⊃ M)} ⊢ Y ⊃ Z 
4. {(W ∨ X) ∨ (Y ∨ Z), X ⊃ Y , ∼Z} ⊢ W ∨ Y
