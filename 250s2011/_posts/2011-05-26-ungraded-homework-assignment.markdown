This is the last ungraded HW assignment, due in class on Tuesday, May 31st. As always, I recommend working through as many exercises as possible, so don't take this assignment as a reason to not work through the unassigned exercises. Also, I highly recommend that you continue to work through the exercises from chapter 7 (symbolization) and chapter 8, sections 1-4 (semantics).

10.1E
:	1a, 1c, 1e, 1i
10.2E
:	1a, 1c, 1i, 1m, 2e, 2i, 2m, 3a, 3e, 5c, 5g, 7g, 7i, 7m

Note that the solutions manual provides detailed walk-throughs for exercises indicated with a '#'.
