Reminder that there is a review session tonight, Sunday June 5th, from 6-7 pm. It will be on the third floor of University Hall, in room 347. If that room proves too small, we'll move downstairs and find an empty classroom.

The final exam is Tuesday, 9:30â€“11:18 am, in our usual lecture hall, Ramseyer 0065.
