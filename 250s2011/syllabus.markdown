## Course Description ##

This course introduces symbolic logic up to and including predicate logic with identity. In addition to becoming comfortable with the basic notions of logic--truth, argument, soundness, validity--you will learn how to symbolize sentences in both sentential logic and predicate logic, how to construct derivations, and how to use truth-tables. Along the way, you will be exposed to some important metatheoretic concepts, including soundness and completeness.

## Requirements ##


## Academic Misconduct  ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers--philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). Please include (a) "301" in the subject line of your email and (b) your full name somewhere in the body of your email.
