The webpage for this course is on [ReggieNet][].

The course approaches the question, "What am I?" in three ways:

1.  Suppose I am a thing that thinks---a thing with a mind. What is the
    relation between my mind and my body?
2.  Suppose I am a thing that persists over time. What does it take me
    to survive from one moment to the next?
3.  Suppose I am a thing with a will. How can a thing with a will be a
    part of a world governed by cause and effect?
