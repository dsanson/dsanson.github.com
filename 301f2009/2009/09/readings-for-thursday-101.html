<h1 class="title">Readings for Thursday 10/1</h1>
<p>By Thursday, you should have read <em>Philosophy Before
Socrates</em>, chapters 1–6, 8, and 10.</p>
<p>I mentioned in class an article on ancient theories of the soul:
Hendrik Lorenz, “<a href=
"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-soul/">Ancient Theories
of Soul</a>.”</p>
<p>I read a couple of testimonia in class that are not in
<em>Philosophy Before Socrates</em>. One of them can be found in
<em>Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy</em>: “The Milesians”,
p.&nbsp;9, fragment 3. The other is not in either of our books:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He [Thales] said that the world is held up by water and rides
like a ship, and when it is said to ‘quake’ it is actually rocking
because of the water’s movement. (Seneca Qu. nat. III, 14)</p>
