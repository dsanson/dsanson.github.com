By Thursday, you should have read *Philosophy Before Socrates*, chapters 1-6, 8, and 10.

I mentioned in class an article on ancient theories of the soul: Hendrik Lorenz, "[Ancient Theories of Soul](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ancient-soul/)."

I read a couple of testimonia in class that are not in *Philosophy Before Socrates*. One of them can be found in *Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy*: "The Milesians", p. 9, fragment 3. The other is not in either of our books:

> He [Thales] said that the world is held up by water and rides like a ship, and when it is said to 'quake' it is actually rocking because of the water's movement. (Seneca Qu. nat. III, 14)
