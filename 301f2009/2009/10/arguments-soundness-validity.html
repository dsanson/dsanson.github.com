<h1 class="title">Arguments, Soundness, Validity</h1>
<p>I’ll be using some jargon throughout the class that I have not
yet explained in class. Some of it comes up in the first paper
assignment, so I thought I’d provide a brief explanation here.</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>argument</em> is a series of statements, one of which is
the conclusion, the others, the premises.</li>
</ul>
<p>We saw two arguments today (Thursday 10/1) in lecture: the
“swamping” argument and the “inheritance” argument. In each, the
last numbered sentence was the conclusion; the others were
premises.</p>
<p>Not all arguments are good arguments. But what makes an argument
good? A good argument has two features: (1) its premises are true;
(2) its conclusion follows from its premises.</p>
<p>‘Follows from the premises’ leaves room for interpretation. On
one prominent and useful interpretation, the conclusion follows
from the premises just in case the argument is valid:</p>
<ul>
<li>An argument is <em>valid</em> if and only if it is impossible
that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is
false.</li>
</ul>
<p>i.e., there is no possible situation that makes all the premises
true but makes the conclusion false.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<ul>
<li>an argument is <em>sound</em> if and only if it is valid and
all of its premises are true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound arguments are good arguments. Notice that if an argument
is sound, its conclusion is true.</p>
<p>Finally, I mention in the paper assignment that I want you to
put an argument into premise-conclusion form. By that I mean that
you put the argument in the form of a series of numbered
statements, each on its own line, with the conclusion last, as
in:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>This is an argument in premise-conclusion form.</li>
<li>Arguments in premise-conclusion form are easier to
criticize.</li>
<li>If an argument is easier to follow, it is easier to
criticize.</li>
<li>Therefore, this argument is easier to <span style=
"text-decoration: line-through;">easier to</span> criticize.</li>
</ol>
<p>(See Scott’s comment to this post for more on this example.)</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>If the ARCHE is APEIRON</li>
<li>then the ARCHE is indefinite</li>
<li>so the ARCHE is indefinite.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not an argument. An argument is a series of statements.
This is a series of statement fragments (or a fragmented sentence).
A quick and easy way to check for this: are the premises and the
conclusion all complete sentences? If not, it is not an
argument.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Should we say that water is the ARCHE?</li>
<li>No, because then everything would be wet.</li>
<li>So the ARCHE is not water.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not an argument. The first premise is a question, not a
statement. Premises and conclusions need to be statements—i.e.,
declarative sentences.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>The ARCHE is APEIRON.</li>
<li>If the ARCHE is APEIRON, then the ARCHE is indefinite.</li>
<li>Therefore, the ARCHE is indefinite.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid. It is not clear whether or not it is
sound: that depends on whether or not (1) and (2) are both
true.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Humans have two legs.</li>
<li>Birds have two legs.</li>
<li>Therefore, anything that has two legs is either a human or a
bird.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument has true premises, but it is not valid, and so not
sound.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Apes have two legs.</li>
<li>Birds have two legs.</li>
<li>Therefore, apes and birds are two different kinds of
animals.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but it is
not valid, and so not sound.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li>
<li>All things made of green cheese do not smell good.</li>
<li>If something is visible in the night sky, it smells good.</li>
<li>Therefore, the moon is not visible in the night sky.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid, but premises 1 and 3 are false (2 is, I
suspect, controversial), so it is not sound.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Whales are fish.</li>
<li>Whales are not fish.</li>
<li>Therefore, the ARCHE is water.</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is valid(!), but it is not sound, since premise
(1) is false. (Why is this argument valid?)</p>
