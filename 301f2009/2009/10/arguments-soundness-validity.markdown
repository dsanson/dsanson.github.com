% Arguments, Soundness, Validity

I'll be using some jargon throughout the class that I have not yet explained in class. Some of it comes up in the first paper assignment, so I thought I'd provide a brief explanation here.

+ An *argument* is a series of statements, one of which is the conclusion, the others, the premises.

We saw two arguments today (Thursday 10/1) in lecture: the "swamping" argument and the "inheritance" argument. In each, the last numbered sentence was the conclusion; the others were premises.

Not all arguments are good arguments. But what makes an argument good? A good argument has two features: (1) its premises are true;  (2) its conclusion follows from its premises.

'Follows from the premises' leaves room for interpretation. On one prominent and useful interpretation, the conclusion follows from the premises just in case the argument is valid:

+ An argument is *valid* if and only if it is impossible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false.

i.e., there is no possible situation that makes all the premises true but makes the conclusion false.

So,

+ an argument is *sound* if and only if it is valid and all of its premises are true.
 
Sound arguments are good arguments. Notice that if an argument is sound, its conclusion is true. 

Finally, I mention in the paper assignment that I want you to put an argument into premise-conclusion form. By that I mean that you put the argument in the form of a series of numbered statements, each on its own line, with the conclusion last, as in:

1. This is an argument in premise-conclusion form.
2. Arguments in premise-conclusion form are easier to criticize.
3. If an argument is easier to follow, it is easier to criticize.
4. Therefore, this argument is easier to ~~easier to~~ criticize.

(See Scott's comment to this post for more on this example.)

# Examples

Here are some examples:

1. If the ARCHE is APEIRON
2. then the ARCHE is indefinite
3. so the ARCHE is indefinite.

This is not an argument. An argument is a series of statements. This is a series of statement fragments (or a fragmented sentence). A quick and easy way to check for this: are the premises and the conclusion all complete sentences? If not, it is not an argument.

1. Should we say that water is the ARCHE?
2. No, because then everything would be wet.
3. So the ARCHE is not water.

This is not an argument. The first premise is a question, not a statement. Premises and conclusions need to be statements---i.e., declarative sentences.

1. The ARCHE is APEIRON.
2. If the ARCHE is APEIRON, then the ARCHE is indefinite.
3. Therefore, the ARCHE is indefinite.

This argument is valid. It is not clear whether or not it is sound: that depends on whether or not (1) and (2) are both true.

1. Humans have two legs.
2. Birds have two legs.
3. Therefore, anything that has two legs is either a human or a bird.

This argument has true premises, but it is not valid, and so not sound.

1. Apes have two legs.
2. Birds have two legs.
3. Therefore, apes and birds are two different kinds of animals.

This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but it is not valid, and so not sound.

1. The moon is made of green cheese.
2. All things made of green cheese do not smell good.
3. If something is visible in the night sky, it smells good.
4. Therefore, the moon is not visible in the night sky.

This argument is valid, but premises 1 and 3 are false (2 is, I suspect, controversial), so it is not sound. 

1. Whales are fish.
2. Whales are not fish.
3. Therefore, the ARCHE is water.

This argument is valid(!), but it is not sound, since premise (1) is false. (Why is this argument valid?)
