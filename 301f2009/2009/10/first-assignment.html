>Aristotle, in <em
  >Physics</em
  > I.8 191a25–29 (<em
  >Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy</em
  >, p. 700), says:</p
><blockquote

  >Those who were the first to search for the truth philosophically and for the nature of beings were diverted and, so to speak, pushed off track by inexperience. They say that nothing that is either comes to be or perishes. For, they say, what comes to be must come to be either from what is or from what is not, and coming to be is impossible in both cases; for what is cannot come to be (since it already is), while nothing can come to be from what is not (since there must be some subject).</p
  ></blockquote
><p
>Presumably he has in mind the argument presented by Parmenides at 11.8 19–22:</p
><blockquote
><p
  >How could what is be in the future? How could it come to be? For if it came into being, it is not, nor <is it> if it is ever going to be. In this way, coming to be has been extinguished and destruction is unheard of.</p
  ></blockquote
><p
>In your paper, I want you to do two things:</p
><p
>I. Reconstruct Aristotle’s version of the argument in <a href="http://davidsanson.com/phil301/2009/10/arguments-soundness-validity.html"
  >premise-conclusion</a
  > form, identifying the key premises, and explaining how the conclusion is supposed to follow from those premises, removing any obvious ambiguity and vagueness.</p

>Then:</p

><li
  >If you think the argument is <a href="http://davidsanson.com/phil301/2009/10/arguments-soundness-validity.html"
    >invalid</a
    >, explain the fallacy.</li
  ><li
  >If you think the argument is <a href="http://davidsanson.com/phil301/2009/10/arguments-soundness-validity.html"
    >valid</a
    > but not <a href="http://davidsanson.com/phil301/2009/10/arguments-soundness-validity.html"
    >sound</a
    >, explain which premise you think is false and (briefly) why.</li
  ><li
  >If you think the argument is <a href="http://davidsanson.com/phil301/2009/10/arguments-soundness-validity.html"
    >sound</a
    >, identify the premise you think a critic is most likely to reject and explain (briefly) why you think it is true.</li
