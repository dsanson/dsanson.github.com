            <p>Due on Thursday, <strong>November 5th</strong>. Answer in no more than 660 words or 2 pages, double-spaced, 1 inch margins, ordinary 12 pt font (e.g., Times).</p><p>At <em>Phaedo</em> 72b, Socrates says:</p><blockquote><p><em>Socrates</em>: If the two processes of becoming did not always balance each other as if they were going round in a circle, but generation proceeded from one point to its opposite in a straight line and it did not turn back again to the other opposite or take any turning, do you realize that all things would ultimately be in the same state, be affected in the same way, and cease to become?</p></blockquote><p>He then applies that reasoning to death and birth (72d)</p><blockquote><p>In the same way, my dear Cebes, if everything that partakes of life were to die and remain in that state and not come to life again, would not everything ultimately have to be dead and nothing alive?</p></blockquote><p>From this he concludes (72d)</p><blockquote><p>Coming to life again in truth exists, the living come to be from the dead, and the souls of the dead exist.</p></blockquote><p>Present, as clearly and carefully as possible, the argument Socrates gives in this passage (not just the bits I&rsquo;ve quoted). Be sure to clearly identify the conclusion, clearly identify the premises&mdash;i.e., the principles and assumptions Socrates and Cebes are making&mdash;and explain how the conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises. Is the argument sound? If you think it is, identify the weakest point in the argument and defend it. If you think it is not sound, explain why it is invalid or which premise is false and why it is false.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>. Whenever I give a paper topic that contains quotes, some students think that they <em>only</em> need to read the quotes. That is a mistake. On the other hand, some students think that they need to provide a synopsis of the <em>entire dialogue</em>. That is also a mistake. The argument that begins at 72b is relatively brief and relatively self-contained. I want you to reconstruct and consider <em>that</em> argument and only that argument. However, to fully understand that argument, you need to read it in context: talk of &lsquo;processes of becoming&rsquo;, for example, is something that is explained earlier. So you can&rsquo;t just blindly read that little bit of text and expect to understand what is going on.</p>

            <p>We did not get through Anaxagoras and Empedocles last time. So for next week, we will start with them before moving quickly past the Atomists and beginning to discuss Socrates. By next Tuesday, I want you to have read both the <em>Apology</em> and the <em>Euthyphro</em>.</p>

            <p>This is a bit ass-backwards, but I created this post to facilitate discussion of Zeno in light of Bill&rsquo;s comment to this post. (Bill&mdash;I&rsquo;ve taken the liberty of moving your comment here.) So read his comment first.</p><p>Contrary to Bill, I don&rsquo;t think that (all of) Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes are &ldquo;word puzzles&rdquo;&mdash;I think they are puzzles concerning infinity, space, time, motion, size, and composition. And I would encourage everyone to be trying <em>both</em> to solve the problems <em>and</em> see how the ancient greeks tried to solve them (I don&rsquo;t think you can appreciate what is good (or bad) about their attempts unless you make the same attempts yourself).</p><p>After reading the McKirahan, a good next step is to read Nick Huggett&rsquo;s <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/">entry on Zeno&rsquo;s paradoxes</a> in the Stanford Encyclopedia, which covers the historical paradoxes and briefly discusses a variety of responses to them; Jon PÃ©rez Laraudogoitia&rsquo;s <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-supertasks/">entry on supertasks</a> discusses the paradoxes and other similar paradoxes and their bearing on contemporary physics and mathematics.</p><p>Comments are open!</p>

They say that nothing that is either comes to be or perishes. For, they say, what comes to be must come to be either from what is or from what is not, and coming to be is impossible in both cases; for what is cannot come to be (since it already is), while nothing can come to be from what is not (since there must be some subject).</p></blockquote><p>Presumably he has in mind the argument presented by Parmenides at 11.8 19&ndash;22:</p><blockquote>How could what is be in the future?

            <p>I&rsquo;ll be using some jargon throughout the class that I have not yet explained in class. Some of it comes up in the first paper assignment, so I thought I&rsquo;d provide a brief explanation here.</p><ul><li>An <em>argument</em> is a series of statements, one of which is the conclusion, the others, the premises.</li></ul><p>We saw two arguments today (Thursday 10/1) in lecture: the &ldquo;swamping&rdquo; argument and the &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; argument. In each, the last numbered sentence was the conclusion; the others were premises.</p><p>Not all arguments are good arguments. But what makes an argument good? A good argument has two features: (1) its premises are true; (2) its conclusion follows from its premises.</p><p>&lsquo;Follows from the premises&rsquo; leaves room for interpretation. On one prominent and useful interpretation, the conclusion follows from the premises just in case the argument is valid:</p><ul><li>An argument is <em>valid</em> if and only if it is impossible that both all of its premises are true and its conclusion is false.</li></ul><p>i.e., there is no possible situation that makes all the premises true but makes the conclusion false.</p><p>So,</p><ul><li>an argument is <em>sound</em> if and only if it is valid and all of its premises are true.</li></ul><p>Sound arguments are good arguments. Notice that if an argument is sound, its conclusion is true.</p><p>Finally, I mention in the paper assignment that I want you to put an argument into premise-conclusion form. By that I mean that you put the argument in the form of a series of numbered statements, each on its own line, with the conclusion last, as in:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>This is an argument in premise-conclusion form.</li><li>Arguments in premise-conclusion form are easier to criticize.</li><li>If an argument is easier to follow, it is easier to criticize.</li><li>Therefore, this argument is easier to <span class="strikeout">easier to</span> criticize.</li></ol><p>(See Scott&rsquo;s comment to this post for more on this example.)</p><h1 id="examples">Examples</h1><p>Here are some examples:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>If the ARCHE is APEIRON</li><li>then the ARCHE is indefinite</li><li>so the ARCHE is indefinite.</li></ol><p>This is not an argument. An argument is a series of statements. This is a series of statement fragments (or a fragmented sentence). A quick and easy way to check for this: are the premises and the conclusion all complete sentences? If not, it is not an argument.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Should we say that water is the ARCHE?</li><li>No, because then everything would be wet.</li><li>So the ARCHE is not water.</li></ol><p>This is not an argument. The first premise is a question, not a statement. Premises and conclusions need to be statements&mdash;i.e., declarative sentences.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>The ARCHE is APEIRON.</li><li>If the ARCHE is APEIRON, then the ARCHE is indefinite.</li><li>Therefore, the ARCHE is indefinite.</li></ol><p>This argument is valid. It is not clear whether or not it is sound: that depends on whether or not (1) and (2) are both true.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Humans have two legs.</li><li>Birds have two legs.</li><li>Therefore, anything that has two legs is either a human or a bird.</li></ol><p>This argument has true premises, but it is not valid, and so not sound.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Apes have two legs.</li><li>Birds have two legs.</li><li>Therefore, apes and birds are two different kinds of animals.</li></ol><p>This argument has true premises and a true conclusion, but it is not valid, and so not sound.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>The moon is made of green cheese.</li><li>All things made of green cheese do not smell good.</li><li>If something is visible in the night sky, it smells good.</li><li>Therefore, the moon is not visible in the night sky.</li></ol><p>This argument is valid, but premises 1 and 3 are false (2 is, I suspect, controversial), so it is not sound.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Whales are fish.</li><li>Whales are not fish.</li><li>Therefore, the ARCHE is water.</li></ol><p>This argument is valid(!), but it is not sound, since premise (1) is false. (Why is this argument valid?)</p><p>You might take this <a href="http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/tvs_quiz.html">online quiz</a> to be sure you understand these definitions.</p>
