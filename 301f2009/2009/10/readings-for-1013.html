<h1 class="title">Readings for 10/13</h1>
<p
>We did not get through Anaxagoras and Empedocles last time. So for next week, we will start with them before moving quickly past the Atomists and beginning to discuss Socrates. By next Tuesday, I want you to have read both the <em
  >Apology</em
  > and the <em
  >Euthyphro</em
  >.</p
