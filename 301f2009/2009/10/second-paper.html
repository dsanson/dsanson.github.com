<h1 class="title">Second Paper</h1>
<p
>Due on Thursday, <strong
  >November 5th</strong
  >. Answer in no more than 660 words or 2 pages, double-spaced, 1 inch margins, ordinary 12 pt font (e.g., Times).</p
><p
>At <em
  >Phaedo</em
  > 72b, Socrates says:</p
><blockquote
><p
  ><em
    >Socrates</em
    >: If the two processes of becoming did not always balance each other as if they were going round in a circle, but generation proceeded from one point to its opposite in a straight line and it did not turn back again to the other opposite or take any turning, do you realize that all things would ultimately be in the same state, be affected in the same way, and cease to become?</p
  ></blockquote
><p
>He then applies that reasoning to death and birth (72d)</p
><blockquote
><p
  >In the same way, my dear Cebes, if everything that partakes of life were to die and remain in that state and not come to life again, would not everything ultimately have to be dead and nothing alive?</p
  ></blockquote
><p
>From this he concludes (72d)</p
><blockquote
><p
  >Coming to life again in truth exists, the living come to be from the dead, and the souls of the dead exist.</p
  ></blockquote
><p
>Present, as clearly and carefully as possible, the argument Socrates gives in this passage (not just the bits I’ve quoted). Be sure to clearly identify the conclusion, clearly identify the premises—i.e., the principles and assumptions Socrates and Cebes are making—and explain how the conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises. Is the argument sound? If you think it is, identify the weakest point in the argument and defend it. If you think it is not sound, explain why it is invalid or which premise is false and why it is false.</p

  >Note</strong
  >. Whenever I give a paper topic that contains quotes, some students think that they <em
  >only</em
  > need to read the quotes. That is a mistake. On the other hand, some students think that they need to provide a synopsis of the <em
  >entire dialogue</em
  >. That is also a mistake. The argument that begins at 72b is relatively brief and relatively self-contained. I want you to reconstruct and consider <em
  >that</em
  > argument and only that argument. However, to fully understand that argument, you need to read it in context: talk of ‘processes of becoming’, for example, is something that is explained earlier. So you can’t just blindly read that little bit of text and expect to understand what is going on.</p
