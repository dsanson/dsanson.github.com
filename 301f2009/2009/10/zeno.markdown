This is a bit ass-backwards, but I created this post to facilitate discussion of Zeno in light of Bill's comment to this post. (Bill---I've taken the liberty of moving your comment here.) So read his comment first.

Contrary to Bill, I don't think that (all of) Zeno's paradoxes are "word puzzles"---I think they are puzzles concerning infinity, space, time, motion, size, and composition. And I would encourage everyone to be trying *both* to solve the problems *and* see how the ancient greeks tried to solve them (I don't think you can appreciate what is good (or bad) about their attempts unless you make the same attempts yourself).

After reading the McKirahan, a good next step is to read Nick Huggett's [entry on Zeno's paradoxes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/) in the Stanford Encyclopedia, which covers the historical paradoxes and briefly discusses a variety of responses to them; Jon PÃ©rez Laraudogoitia's [entry on supertasks](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-supertasks/) discusses the paradoxes and other similar paradoxes and their bearing on contemporary physics and mathematics.
