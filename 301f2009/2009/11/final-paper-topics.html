    >At <em
      >Meno</em
      > 80d-e, Meno raises the so-called “Paradox of Inquiry.” Explain what that paradox is, how Plato’s theory of recollection provides a solution. In <em
      >Posterior Analytics</em
      > II 19, Aristotle objects to Plato’s theory and presents an alternate solution of his own. Explain what Aristotle’s solution is, comparing and contrasting it to Plato’s. Along they way, you should reconstruct Aristotle’s objections to Plato’s solution and assess their force.</p

    >In the <em
      >Categories</em
      >, Aristotle makes a distinction between primary substances, secondary substances, and accidents. In the <em
      >Phaedo</em
      >, Plato makes a distinction between individuals, forms, and forms in individuals. Compare and contrast the two sets of distinctions and the work they are supposed to do.</p
