I'll add more prompts. I am not 100% happy with these prompts, and welcome advice on how to improve them.

## Instructions

Your paper should be no more than 1500 words (roughly five pages). It should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1 inch margins on all sides.

Your paper is due on **Wednesday, December 9th at 5 pm**. Hard copies can be left in my box in the Philosophy Department Office, University Hall 350 or Scott's box in the Philosophy TA Office, University Hall 215. Electronic submissions **will not** be accepted.

## Prompts

1. At *Meno* 80d-e, Meno raises the so-called "Paradox of Inquiry." Explain what that paradox is, how Plato's theory of recollection provides a solution. In *Posterior Analytics* II 19, Aristotle objects to Plato's theory and presents an alternate solution of his own. Explain what Aristotle's solution is, comparing and contrasting it to Plato's. Along they way, you should reconstruct Aristotle's objections to Plato's solution and assess their force.

2. In the *Categories*, Aristotle makes a distinction between primary substances, secondary substances, and accidents. In the *Phaedo*, Plato makes a distinction between individuals, forms, and forms in individuals. Compare and contrast the two sets of distinctions and the work they are supposed to do.
