            <p>It is time for you to evaluate me. These evaluations are important: I use them to try to figure out how to do things better; they also play a role in tenure and promotion decisions. (I&rsquo;ll be coming up for tenure in two years, so this looms large for me.) I appreciate the time you spend doing this.</p><p>I&rsquo;m told that you can access the rating form by visiting your class schedule for this term and clicking the &ldquo;Evaluation&rdquo; button next to our class. (I think that <a href="http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/scansurvey/sei/studentinstructions.html">this page</a> should also get you where you need to go.)</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have access to the online forms, and all the information you provide is anonymous. I won&rsquo;t get any feedback until after I&rsquo;ve turned in your grades.</p><p>There are 10 questions and a textbox for open-ended comments. Those comments are especially helpful. In particular, I&rsquo;m interested to hear your thoughts about:</p><ol class="decimal"><li>class lecture/discussion: did you find it valuable? did it increase your understanding of the material? where there things I could have done (or not done) to improve it?</li><li>topics/readings: were the readings useful? did you enjoy the topics/authors? were there topics/authors you&rsquo;d have liked to cover which we did not? topics/authors we covered you&rsquo;d just as well not have covered?</li><li>assignments: I&rsquo;d like to know what you think both about quantity and quality. Did the assignments push you in good ways to better understand the material? Were they too hard? Were there enough/too many assignments? (There were no exams, only papers: do you think there should have been an exam or two, in addition to papers?)</li></ol><p>I&rsquo;m told that once the SEI form is submitted, you can&rsquo;t edit it in any way. If you&rsquo;ve already filled the form out but would like to provide additional anonymous feedback, you can write something up and give it to our department secretary, Michelle Brown (350 University Hall; brown.930@osu.edu). And, of course, I always welcome non-anonymous feedback as well.</p><p>The online SEI forms are available until the last day of classes, <strong>Friday, December 4</strong>. The deadline cannot be extended, so please make sure you respond before finals week. For more info see <a href="http://www.sei.osu.edu">http://www.sei.osu.edu</a></p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ll add more prompts. I am not 100% happy with these prompts, and welcome advice on how to improve them.</p><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><p>Your paper should be no more than 1500 words (roughly five pages). It should be double-spaced, 12 pt font, with 1 inch margins on all sides.</p><p>Your paper is due on <strong>Wednesday, December 9th at 5 pm</strong>. Hard copies can be left in my box in the Philosophy Department Office, University Hall 350 or Scott&rsquo;s box in the Philosophy TA Office, University Hall 215. Electronic submissions <strong>will not</strong> be accepted.</p><h2 id="prompts">Prompts</h2><ol class="decimal"><li><p>At <em>Meno</em> 80d-e, Meno raises the so-called &ldquo;Paradox of Inquiry.&rdquo; Explain what that paradox is, how Plato&rsquo;s theory of recollection provides a solution. In <em>Posterior Analytics</em> II 19, Aristotle objects to Plato&rsquo;s theory and presents an alternate solution of his own. Explain what Aristotle&rsquo;s solution is, comparing and contrasting it to Plato&rsquo;s. Along they way, you should reconstruct Aristotle&rsquo;s objections to Plato&rsquo;s solution and assess their force.</p></li><li><p>In the <em>Categories</em>, Aristotle makes a distinction between primary substances, secondary substances, and accidents. In the <em>Phaedo</em>, Plato makes a distinction between individuals, forms, and forms in individuals. Compare and contrast the two sets of distinctions and the work they are supposed to do.</p></li></ol>

Is he claiming that there are two separate &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;, a world of eternal being, and a world of temporal becoming? If so, how are those worlds related? Or is there some other way of taking his contrast, that doesn&rsquo;t commit him to two separate worlds?</p>
