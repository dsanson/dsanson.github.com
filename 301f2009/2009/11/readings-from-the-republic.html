>As you read these passages, I want you to be thinking about how Plato thinks <em
  >becoming</em
  >, which he associates with opinion and the senses, is related to <em
  >being</em
  >, which he associates with the knowledge and the intellect. Is he claiming that there are two separate “worlds”, a world of eternal being, and a world of temporal becoming? If so, how are those worlds related? Or is there some other way of taking his contrast, that doesn’t commit him to two separate worlds?</p
