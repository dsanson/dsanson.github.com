Focus on the principle Socrates uses to divide the soul into parts.

-   Republic V 474c-end
-   Republic VI 504e-end
-   Republic VII 514a-535a

As you read these passages, I want you to be thinking about how Plato thinks *becoming*, which he associates with opinion and the senses, is related to *being*, which he associates with the knowledge and the intellect. Is he claiming that there are two separate "worlds", a world of eternal being, and a world of temporal becoming? If so, how are those worlds related? Or is there some other way of taking his contrast, that doesn't commit him to two separate worlds?
