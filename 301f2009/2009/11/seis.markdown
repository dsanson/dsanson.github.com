It is time for you to evaluate me. These evaluations are important: I use them to try to figure out how to do things better; they also play a role in tenure and promotion decisions. (I'll be coming up for tenure in two years, so this looms large for me.) I appreciate the time you spend doing this.

I'm told that you can access the rating form by visiting your class schedule for this term and clicking the "Evaluation" button next to our class. (I think that [this page](http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/scansurvey/sei/studentinstructions.html) should also get you where you need to go.)

I don't have access to the online forms, and all the information you provide is anonymous. I won't get any feedback until after I've turned in your grades.  

There are 10 questions and a textbox for open-ended comments. Those comments are especially helpful. In particular, I'm interested to hear your thoughts about:

1. class lecture/discussion: did you find it valuable? did it increase your understanding of the material? where there things I could have done (or not done) to improve it?
2. topics/readings: were the readings useful? did you enjoy the topics/authors? were there topics/authors you'd have liked to cover which we did not? topics/authors we covered you'd just as well not have covered?
3. assignments: I'd like to know what you think both about quantity and quality. Did the assignments push you in good ways to better understand the material? Were they too hard? Were there enough/too many assignments? (There were no exams, only papers: do you think there should have been an exam or two, in addition to papers?)

I'm told that once the SEI form is submitted, you can't edit it in any way. If you've already filled the form out but would like to provide additional anonymous feedback, you can write something up and give it to our department secretary, Michelle Brown (350 University Hall; brown.930@osu.edu). And, of course, I always welcome non-anonymous feedback as well.
 
The online SEI forms are available until the last day of classes, **Friday, December 4**. The deadline cannot be extended, so please make sure you respond before finals week. For more info see [http://www.sei.osu.edu](http://www.sei.osu.edu)

Thanks.
