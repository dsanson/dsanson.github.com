                                                It is time for you to evaluate me. These evaluations are important: I use them to try to figure out how to do things better; they also play a role in tenure and promotion decisions. (I’ll be coming up for tenure in two years, so this looms large for me.) I appreciate the time you spend doing this.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I’m told that you can access the rating form by visiting your class schedule for this term and clicking the “Evaluation” button next to our class. (I think that <a href="http://www.ureg.ohio-state.edu/ourweb/scansurvey/sei/studentinstructions.html">this page</a> should also get you where you need to go.)
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I don’t have access to the online forms, and all the information you provide is anonymous. I won’t get any feedback until after I’ve turned in your grades.
                                            </p>

                                                There are 10 questions and a textbox for open-ended comments. Those comments are especially helpful. In particular, I’m interested to hear your thoughts about:
                                            </p>
                                            <ol class="decimal">
                                                <li>class lecture/discussion: did you find it valuable? did it increase your understanding of the material? where there things I could have done (or not done) to improve it?
                                                </li>
                                                <li>topics/readings: were the readings useful? did you enjoy the topics/authors? were there topics/authors you’d have liked to cover which we did not? topics/authors we covered you’d just as well not have covered?
                                                </li>
                                                <li>assignments: I’d like to know what you think both about quantity and quality. Did the assignments push you in good ways to better understand the material? Were they too hard? Were there enough/too many assignments? (There were no exams, only papers: do you think there should have been an exam or two, in addition to papers?)
                                                </li>

                                                I’m told that once the SEI form is submitted, you can’t edit it in any way. If you’ve already filled the form out but would like to provide additional anonymous feedback, you can write something up and give it to our department secretary, Michelle Brown (350 University Hall; brown.930@osu.edu). And, of course, I always welcome non-anonymous feedback as well.

                                                The online SEI forms are available until the last day of classes, <strong>Friday, December 4</strong>. The deadline cannot be extended, so please make sure you respond before finals week. For more info see <a href="http://www.sei.osu.edu">http://www.sei.osu.edu</a>

                                                        At <em>Meno</em> 80d-e, Meno raises the so-called “Paradox of Inquiry.” Explain what that paradox is, how Plato’s theory of recollection provides a solution. In <em>Posterior Analytics</em> II 19, Aristotle objects to Plato’s theory and presents an alternate solution of his own. Explain what Aristotle’s solution is, comparing and contrasting it to Plato’s. Along they way, you should reconstruct Aristotle’s objections to Plato’s solution and assess their force.

                                                        In the <em>Categories</em>, Aristotle makes a distinction between primary substances, secondary substances, and accidents. In the <em>Phaedo</em>, Plato makes a distinction between individuals, forms, and forms in individuals. Compare and contrast the two sets of distinctions and the work they are supposed to do.

                                                As you read these passages, I want you to be thinking about how Plato thinks <em>becoming</em>, which he associates with opinion and the senses, is related to <em>being</em>, which he associates with the knowledge and the intellect. Is he claiming that there are two separate “worlds”, a world of eternal being, and a world of temporal becoming? If so, how are those worlds related? Or is there some other way of taking his contrast, that doesn’t commit him to two separate worlds?

                                                Due on Thursday, <strong>November 5th</strong>. Answer in no more than 660 words or 2 pages, double-spaced, 1 inch margins, ordinary 12 pt font (e.g., Times).

                                                At <em>Phaedo</em> 72b, Socrates says:
                                            </p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>
                                                    <em>Socrates</em>: If the two processes of becoming did not always balance each other as if they were going round in a circle, but generation proceeded from one point to its opposite in a straight line and it did not turn back again to the other opposite or take any turning, do you realize that all things would ultimately be in the same state, be affected in the same way, and cease to become?
                                                </p>
                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>
                                                He then applies that reasoning to death and birth (72d)
                                            </p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>
                                                    In the same way, my dear Cebes, if everything that partakes of life were to die and remain in that state and not come to life again, would not everything ultimately have to be dead and nothing alive?
                                                </p>

                                            <p>
                                                From this he concludes (72d)
                                            </p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>
                                                    Coming to life again in truth exists, the living come to be from the dead, and the souls of the dead exist.
                                                </p>

                                                Present, as clearly and carefully as possible, the argument Socrates gives in this passage (not just the bits I’ve quoted). Be sure to clearly identify the conclusion, clearly identify the premises—i.e., the principles and assumptions Socrates and Cebes are making—and explain how the conclusion is supposed to follow from the premises. Is the argument sound? If you think it is, identify the weakest point in the argument and defend it. If you think it is not sound, explain why it is invalid or which premise is false and why it is false.
                                            </p>

                                                <strong>Note</strong>. Whenever I give a paper topic that contains quotes, some students think that they <em>only</em> need to read the quotes. That is a mistake. On the other hand, some students think that they need to provide a synopsis of the <em>entire dialogue</em>. That is also a mistake. The argument that begins at 72b is relatively brief and relatively self-contained. I want you to reconstruct and consider <em>that</em> argument and only that argument. However, to fully understand that argument, you need to read it in context: talk of ‘processes of becoming’, for example, is something that is explained earlier. So you can’t just blindly read that little bit of text and expect to understand what is going on.

                                                This is a bit ass-backwards, but I created this post to facilitate discussion of Zeno in light of Bill’s comment to this post. (Bill—I’ve taken the liberty of moving your comment here.) So read his comment first.

                                                Contrary to Bill, I don’t think that (all of) Zeno’s paradoxes are “word puzzles”—I think they are puzzles concerning infinity, space, time, motion, size, and composition. And I would encourage everyone to be trying <em>both</em> to solve the problems <em>and</em> see how the ancient greeks tried to solve them (I don’t think you can appreciate what is good (or bad) about their attempts unless you make the same attempts yourself).

                                                After reading the McKirahan, a good next step is to read Nick Huggett’s <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/">entry on Zeno’s paradoxes</a> in the Stanford Encyclopedia, which covers the historical paradoxes and briefly discusses a variety of responses to them; Jon Pérez Laraudogoitia’s <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-supertasks/">entry on supertasks</a> discusses the paradoxes and other similar paradoxes and their bearing on contemporary physics and mathematics.
