            Course Description
        </h1>
        <p>
            This course is an introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy, from its traditional beginning in 585 BCE to the death of Arisotle in 322 BCE. We will cover several Presocratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Our primary focus will be on issues in natural philosophy and metaphysics, but issues in ethics, philosophy of mind, and theology will also come up.

            Requirements
        </h1>
        <p>
            Your grade will be based upon three papers: one short (1 page) paper (worth 20%) due the second week of class; one 3–4 page paper (worth 40%) due in week 5; and one 5 page paper (worth 40%) due finals week. There will be no final exam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we will make no attempt to quantify this factor, regular substantive participation—especially in recitation discussion—can also improve your grade.
        </p>
        <h1 id="academic-misconduct">
            Academic Misconduct
        </h1>
        <p>
            You are strongly encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers—philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <a href="http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq"><code>http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq</code></a>

        <p>
            If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me <strong>now</strong> to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. Office for Disability Services, 150 Pomerene Hall, 292–3307.

            Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won’t take this as harassment).
