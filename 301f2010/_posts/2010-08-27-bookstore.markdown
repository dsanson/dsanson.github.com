I seem to have screwed up the textbook order. The bookstores have one of the two required books, *Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy*, but not the other, *Philosophy before Socrates*. (ISBNs and further details [here](textbook.html)).

I just put in an (other?) order for *Philosophy Before Socrates*. In the meantime, it is, of course, available online from the usual online sources. It looks like new copies are running a bit under $20, used copies around $15.
