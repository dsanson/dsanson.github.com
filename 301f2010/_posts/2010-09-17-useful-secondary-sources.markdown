I want you to spend most of your time in this course struggling directly with primary sources, using class lecture and discussion to help guide your focus. But there are several online resources that you may find useful along the way. Here are a few:

+   [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu). Lots of good stuff here. You could start by searching "Presocratic Philosophy," "Socrates," "Plato," or "Aristotle". Note that the bottom of each article has links to other related articles.

+   Marc Cohen's [Lecture Notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/320Lecture.html) from a class that he teaches at the University of Washington that covers much of the same material that we will cover.

+   The [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu) offers original Greek versions of our texts along with English translations. You should not rely on these translations in lieu of the ones in our texts, but it is a useful resource.
