For next Tuesday, I want you to start reading through the chapters in McKirahan on the Milesians. In particular, chapters 4, 5, and 6.

Here are some questions to be thinking about:

# The Arche (i.e., Fundamental Material Principle of All Things)

+   Is it obvious that Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes think of the *arche* in the same way that Aristotle thinks about matter?
    +   What are the alternative interpretations?
+   What is Anaximander's argument against Thales' claim that the *arche* is water?
+   What does it mean to say that the *arche* is *apeiron*? 
+   What is Anaximenes arguments against Anaximander's claim that the *arche* is *apeiron*?

# The Earth

+   Anaximander does not think the Earth is supported by anything. How can he say this?
