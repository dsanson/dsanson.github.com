I've read a few testimonia in lecture that are not in *Philosophy Before Socrates*:

> Others say that the earth rests on water. For this is the most ancient account we have received, which they say was given by Thales the Milesian, that it stays in place through floating like a log or some other such thing (for none of these rests by nature on air, but on water) as though the same argument did not apply to the water supporting the earth as to the earth itself. (Aristotle, On the Heavens 2.13 294a28-34) (you can find a different translation of this passage in *Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy*, p. 9)

> Aristotle and Hippias say that he gave a share of soul even to inanimate objects, using Magnesian stone [i.e., magnet] and amber as indications. Thales, too, seems, from what they relate, to have supposed that the soul was something kinetic, if he said that the [Magnesian] stone [i.e., a magnet] possesses soul because it moves iron. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of Philosophers* 1.24) (See also *Readings in Ancient Greek Philosophy* p. 10)

> He [Thales] said that the world is held up by water and rides like a ship, and when it is said to 'quake' it is actually rocking because of the water's movement. (Seneca Qu. nat. III, 14)

The article I mentioned in class is:
