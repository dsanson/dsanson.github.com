The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has two nice articles that, taken together, should give you a sense of the current state of play when it comes to Zeno's paradoxes:

+   [Zeno's Paradoxes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/), by Nick Huggett
+   [Supertasks](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-supertasks/), by Jon PÃ©rez Laraudogoitia
