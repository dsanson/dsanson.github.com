The [OSU Undergraduate Philosophy Club](http://philosophy.org.ohio-state.edu/) meets tonight, Wednesday Oct 6, at 7:30 pm in University Hall 347. Here are some details from their email announcement:


> The first meeting will be an informational introductory session held by Professor Tamar Rudavsky. The meeting is intended for incoming undergraduates interested in the Philosophy Department (both freshmen and Philosophy majors/minors new to the program.) Professor Rudavsky will talk briefly about the major, the department, and the classes available to undergraduates. Several officers of the club will be in attendance to introduce the club and to help answer any questions about the philosophy club and major. You are NOT required to be a declared major/minor to attend this or any other meeting of the Philosophy Club. We welcome all students interested in learning more about philosophy and about the philosophy major. This meeting, however, is particularly useful for incoming students to the university (and major) to learn more about the program and to meet other incoming students to the university.
