For next Tuesday, October 12th, read chapter 12, on Zeno, in *Philosophy Before Socrates*. For next Thursday, October 15th, read chapters 13, 14, and 16.

Tuesday's lecture will be devoted to Parmenides and Zeno. Thursday's lecture will be devoted to the Pluralists---Anaxagoras and Empedocles---and the Atomists---Leucippus and Democritus.

And that will be that for Presocratic Philosophy.
