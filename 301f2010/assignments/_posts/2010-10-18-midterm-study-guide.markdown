# Instructions #

This is a study guide for the midterm in class on **Tuesday, October 26th**. The midterm will be closed book, closed notes. I will provide blue books. You will have the entire class period to complete the midterm.

The midterm will consist of some short answer/fill-in the blank questions and some essay questions. If you have done the reading, attended lecture, and worked through the questions on this study guide before the exam, you should be well-prepared.

# Quotes #

You should be prepared to identify quotes that express views that are distinctive of a given philosopher, e.g.,

-   Some declare that it [the soul] is mixed in the whole [universe], and perhaps this is why \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ thought all things are full of gods.
-   There is no motion because that which is moving must reach the midpoint before the end: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Questions

All questions (other than quote identification) will either be taken from the questions below or closely related to the questions below. 

1.  What role did water play for Thales, according to Aristotle?
2.  According to Aristotle there are four different sorts of cause. Explain his view, giving examples that illustrate each of the four causes.
3.  Give an example to illustrate the point that X can be made *from* Y (have Y as its origin) without being made *of* Y (without being composed of Y). On one interpretation of Thales, everything is made *from* water, but everything is not made *of* water. Explain this interpretation, and contrast it with Aristotle's interpretation.
4.  Explain the following quote, and what it suggests about Thales' views on souls:

    Thales, too, seems, from what they relate, to have supposed that the soul was something kinetic, if he said that the [Magnesian] stone [i.e., a magnet] possesses soul because it moves iron. (Diogenes Laertius, *Lives of Philosophers* 1.24)"

5.  Explain the following quote, and what it suggests about Thales' views about gods and souls:

    **4.9** Some declare that it [the soul] is mixed in the whole [universe], and perhaps this is why Thales thought all things are full of gods.

6.  Compare and contrast the views of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes on the question of how the earth is supported.
7.  Present Anaximander's "Swamping Argument" against the view that the *arche* is water.
8.  What is meant by Anaximander's claim that the *arche* is *apeiron*?
9.  What role do Justice and Injustice play in Anaximander's account of the cosmos?
10. What, according to Anaximenes, is the *arche*? How does Anaximenes' account avoid the problems raised by Anaximander's swamping argument?
11. Explain the role of condensation and rarefaction for Anaximenes.
12. According to Anaximenes,

    **6.3** the breath becomes cold when compressed and condensed by the lips, and when the mouth is relaxed, the escaping breath becomes warm through rareness.

    What does Anaximenes take this observation to illustrate?
13. What is the role of motion in Anaximenes' account of the cosmos?
14. Explain the following quote from Heraclitus:

    **10.49** They do not understand how, though at variance with itself, it agrees with itself. It is a *backwards-turning* attunement like that of the bow and lyre.

15. Explain and contrast the following three claims about rivers, all attributed to Heraclitus:

    **10.64** Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.  
    **10.65** [It is not possible to step twice into the same river].... It scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes.  
    **10.66** We step into and we do not step into the same rivers. We are and we are not.  

16. Briefly explain the Three Ways of Inquiry, according to Parmenides.
17. Explain what is meant by Parmenides' claim that "that which is there to be *spoken* and *thought* of must be."
18. How might Parmenides respond to the following challenge to the above principle: Superman is not, but Superman can be spoken of, so that which is there to be spoken need not be.
19. How might Parmenides respond to the following challenge: Superman is not, but the *idea* of Superman is, so Superman can be thought of.
20. Assess the following argument, attributed to Zeno:

    If things that are are many, they must therefore be both like and unlike, but this is impossible. For unlike things cannot be like, nor can like things be unlike.

21. Present the Dichotomy *aka* the Stadium (one of Zeno's paradoxes: see p. 187 of *Philosophy Before Socrates*). Present one of Arisotle's two responses to the Stadium.
22. In what sense is it true, according to Anaxagoras, that nothing ever comes to be or ceases to be?
23. Explain Anaxagoras' claim that everything is a mixture of all the basic things. How, given this view, does Anaxagoras account for the difference between, say, a hunk of gold and glassful of water?
24. What, according to Empedocles, are the four elements?
25. Explain the role played by love and strife in Empedocles account of the cosmos. According to Empedocles, the cosmos cycles between periods of perfect love and perfect strife. Explain that cycle, and explain where we currently are in it.
