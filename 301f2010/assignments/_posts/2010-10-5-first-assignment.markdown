**Your task**. Present and evaluate Anaximander’s account of the coming to be of hot and cold from the ARCHE in no more than 2 pages (650 words), double spaced, 12 pt font, 1" margins.

**Due** in class on **October 12th**.

## Texts

You will want to look carefully at passage 5.6 of Philosophy Before Socrates, which reports on Anaximander’s account of how hot and cold come to be from the ARCHE, and, then, more concretely, how the earth, the sun, the moon, and the stars come to be from hot and cold.

> 5.6 He declares that what arose from the eternal and is productive of hot and cold was separated off at the coming to be of this KOSMOS, and a kind of sphere of flame grew around the dark mist about the earth like bark about a tree. When it was broken off and  enclosed in circles, the sun, moon, and stars came to be.

You may also want to look at Passage 5.8, which echoes this account, reiterating the role of ‘separating off’ in explaining the coming to be of the stars, and providing more detail about the resulting KOSMOS, and the role played by flame and dark mist.

And you will, of course, want to look at what McKirahan has to say about these passages.

## In order to clearly present the account, you will need to say at least:

+   What distinct things or principles are involved in his account?
+   How does the thing productive of the hot and cold arise from the eternal?
+   How do the hot and cold subsequently arise from the thing productive of hot and cold?
+   What is “separating off” and what role does it play in the account?

## Evaluating the account is tricky

Of course you think Anaximander’s account is factually incorrect. But I’d like you to try to think about how well the account does on its own terms:

+   Are there gaps in the explanation?
+   Are there mysterious transitions that are being left unexplained?
+   Are there plausible ways to try to fill out Anaximander’s account, filling in those gaps or addressing those mysteries?

## The best papers will

1.  present the view as clearly as possible
2.  raise some compelling problem for the view and
3.  suggest some plausible moves Anaximander might make in response to that problem.

## Additional tips

1.  Do not stray from the topic. I don’t want a paper that broadly redescribes Anaximander’s account of coming to be of hot and cold, earth, sun, moon, and stars. That is too broad—it goes beyond the scope of the topic—and too shallow—it doesn’t dig in and engage with Anaximander.

    You may bring in points that are not directly related to the topic—for example, you might want to consider whether Anaximander’s use of “separating off” when accounting for the origin of the earth or stars is helpful for understanding the role played by “separating off” in the coming to be of hot and cold. But you should always remember that your primary goal is to explain the coming to be of hot and cold.

2.  Anaximander’s account is expressed obscurely in our sources. This does not mean that your presentation of Anaximander’s account can be obscure too. Your goal is not to reproduce the obscurity. Your goal is to express, as clearly as possible, what you think Anaximander might have meant, given the obscure things we are told about him.
