# Instructions

**REVISED**: I have revised question 14 and question 3.

**REVISED**: I have removed questions 18 and 20.

This is a study guide for the final exam. The final will be in our usual lecture hall, Caldwell Lab 0120, on Wednesday, December 8th, from 11:30 am to 1:18 pm. It will be closed book, closed notes. I will provide blue books.

The format of the final will be much like the format of the midterm: some short-answer/fill-in-the-blank questions and some essay questions. There will be no quotation identification questions this time around.

If you have done the reading, attended lecture, and worked through the questions on this study guide before the exam, you should be well-prepared.

The final will be cummulative. In addition to the questions below, questions on the [midterm study guide](http://www.davidsanson.com/301f2010/assignments/midterm-study-guide.html) are fair game. All questions will either be taken from the questions on the two study guides, or (in the case of short answer questions) closely related to the questions on the two study guides.

# Questions

1.  In the *Apology*, Socrates claims that while he may possess *human wisdom*, he does not possess *superhuman wisdom*. What does he intend by this contrast? What is human wisdom, and what is superhuman wisdom? Why does Socrates deny that he has superhuman wisodm?

2.  At *Apology* 36d, Socrates says, of "one who has won a victory at Olympia", that "he makes you think you're happy, whereas I make you actually happy." Does this contrast make sense? What does Socrates do that he thinks makes Athenians happy?

3.  At *Euthyphro* ~~7e~~ 6e, Euthyphro says that "what's love by the gods is pious, and what's not loved by the gods is impious." An argument is then given against this definition of piety and impiety. Present and evaluate the argument.

4.  At *Euthphryo* 9e, Euthyphro says that "the pious is what all the gods love, and its opposite, what all gods hate, is the impious." An argument is then given against this definition of piety and impiety. Present and evaluate the argument.

5.  At *Euthyphro* 10b-c, as part of his argument against the definition proposed by Euthyphro at 9e, Socrates says, "If something's changing in some way or affected in some way, it's not changed because it's a changed thing; rather, it's a changed thing because it's changed." In the surrounding text, he provides several examples that are intended to support and illustrate this principle. Using some of his examples or some of your own examples, explain this principle.

6.  At *Phaedo* 64c and following, Socrates presents the outline of an argument for the conclusion that Philosophers should welcome death. The remainder of *Phaedo* is spent defending the premises of this argument. Present the argument Socrates outlines.

7.  At *Phaedo* 72d, Socrates concludes, "Coming to life again in truth exists, the living come to be from the dead, and the souls of the dead exist." Present and evaluate his argument for this conclusion.

8.  What, according to Socrates, explains our cognitive capacity to see two sticks as equal?

9.  Socrates argues that your capacity to see two sticks as equal entails that your soul pre-existed your body. Present and evaluate his argument for this conclusion.

10.  In the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues against a variety of explanations from "natural science". His argument presupposes three causal principles. Present those three causal principles, and, for each of those causal principles, present an example of an explanation that violates it, and explain why the example violates the principle.

11.  Socrates claims that an explanation in terms of a Form is "the safest answer I can give myself or anyone else" (*Phaedo* 100e). What does he mean? In what sense are these explanations "safe"? Are there other senses in which they are not "safe"?

12.  In the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues that since the soul is that which, present in a body, makes it living, the soul must be indestructible. Present and evaluate his argument for this conclusion.

13.  At *Republic* IV.436b and following, Socrates argues that the soul has three parts. Present and evaluate his argument for this claim. Along the way, be sure to explain what the three parts of the soul are, according to Socrates.

14.  At *Republic* V.477d and following, Socrates argues that knowledge and opinion are set over different objects~~: knowledge is set over what is, and opinion is set over what both is and is not~~. Present and evaluate his argument for this conclusion. **NOTE**: Edited question: all I want is the argument for the conclusion that they have different objects, not the further argument concerning what those objects are.

15.  Briefly recount the *Allegory of the Cave*, explaining its philosophical significance.

16.  Explain Aristotle's distinction between *homonymous*, *synonymous*, and *paronymous* things.

17.  Explain Aristotle's distinction between primary substance and secondary substance.

18.  ~~Explain Aristotle's distinction between contraries and contradictories.~~

19.  In *Physics* I.8, Aristotle presents an argument for the conclusion that nothing comes to be or perishes. His first response to the argument involves a distinction between coincidental and non-coincidental coming to be. Present the argument, present this response to it, and evaluate its force as a response.

20.  ~~In *Physics* I.8, Aristotle  presents an argument for the conclusion that nothing comes to be or perishes. His second response to the argument involves a distinction between potentiality and actuality. (He discusses this response at greater length in *Metaphysics* IX.) Present the argument, present this response to it, and evaluate its force as a response.~~
