The course divides into three chronological chunks:

1. Presocratic Philosophy
2. Socrates and Plato
3. Aristotle

We will work through the following texts in order, planning to spend roughly three weeks on each section. As we fall behind (which we always do), we will have to make decisions about what to skip past.

As we go along, I will post recommended but optional supplementary readings.
