Parmenides is a hard nut to crack. It can help to read other people's attempts to crack that nut. McKirahan's discussion is a good place to start. For an another overview, see the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/parmenides). And here are two articles that are considerably more challenging, but might be helpful:

+   Anscombe, GEM. 1968. "[Parmenides, Mystery and Contradiction](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/stable/4544772)". *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*.
+   Furth, Montgomery. 1968. "[Elements of Eleatic Ontology](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_philosophy/toc/hph6.2.html)". *Journal of the History of Philosophy*.
