In class I mentioned Quine's paper "[Identity, Ostension, and Hypostasis](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2021795)" ([off-campus link](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/stable/2021795)). Section I is relevant to our passages 10.64, 10.65, and 10.66. Later sections are rough going, but are relevant to issues that will arise in Plato and Aristotle.
