## Requirements ##

1. Two Papers
    +   One short (1 or 2 page) paper, worth 20% of your grade, due early in the term
    +   One longer (4 or 5 page) paper, worth 30% of your grade, due late in the term

2. Two Exams
    +   An in-class midterm exam, worth 20% of your grade, on Tuesday, October 26th
    +   A final exam, worth 30% of your grade, on December 8th, from 11:30am--1:18pm, in our ordinary lecture hall.

I will not let you take the final exam on a different day in order to accomodate your exciting winter break travel plans. Don't ask. Don't let your parents ask.

## Academic Misconduct  ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers--philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But **your papers must be your own work**, and **all sources must be cited**. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms, and you are responsible for understanding it: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me outside of class and office hours. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). 

Please include "301" in the subject line of your email and your full name somewhere in the body of your email.

Before you dash off an email, take a moment to think about whether or not it is appropriate to do so. For example,

+   Don't email me to ask what happened in a class you missed (get notes from a classmate). 
+   Do email me if you are sick or have a genuine emergency and need to miss class or have missed class.
+   Don't email me to ask me to read a draft (I am happy to look over drafts in office hours). 
+   Don't email me your paper without specific prior arrangment: hand it in in class.
+   Do email me if you want to make an appointment and cannot make my office hours.

	3.   Students examine and interpret how the human condition and human values are explored through works of art and humanistic writings.
 
	*	Literature
		1.   Students learn to analyze, appreciate, and interpret significant literary works.
		2.   Through reading, discussing, and writing about literature, students learn to understand and evaluate the personal and social values of their own and other cultures.

	*	Diversity
		1.    Students exhibit an understanding of some combination of political, economic, cultural, physical, social, and philosophical differences in or among the world's nations, peoples and cultures outside the US.
		2.    Students are able to describe, analyze and critically evaluate the roles of categories such as race, gender, class, ethnicity, national origin and religion as they relate to international/global institutions, issues, cultures and citizenship.
		3.    Students recognize the role of national and international diversity in shaping their own attitudes and values as global citizens.
