## Academic Misconduct  ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers--philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). Please include (a) "301" in the subject line of your email and (b) your full name somewhere in the body of your email. 

## GEC Categories ##

This course has been approved to fulfill both the *Arts & Humanities Literature* requirement and the *Arts & Humanities Diversity (International--Western)* requirement. The expected learning outcomes associated with these requirements are reproduced below. This course aims to achieve these outcomes through intensive reading and analysis of those ancient greek philosophical texts that arguably form the backbone of western intellectual culture. 

* Arts and Humanities
	1.   Students develop abilities to be informed observers of, or active participants in, the visual, spatial, performing, spoken, or literary arts.
	2.   Students develop an understanding of the foundations of human beliefs, the nature of reality, and the norms that guide human behavior.
	3.   Students examine and interpret how the human condition and human values are explored through works of art and humanistic writings.
 
	*	Literature
		1.   Students learn to analyze, appreciate, and interpret significant literary works.
		2.   Through reading, discussing, and writing about literature, students learn to understand and evaluate the personal and social values of their own and other cultures.

	*	Diversity
		1.    Students exhibit an understanding of some combination of political, economic, cultural, physical, social, and philosophical differences in or among the world's nations, peoples and cultures outside the US.
		2.    Students are able to describe, analyze and critically evaluate the roles of categories such as race, gender, class, ethnicity, national origin and religion as they relate to international/global institutions, issues, cultures and citizenship.
		3.    Students recognize the role of national and international diversity in shaping their own attitudes and values as global citizens.
