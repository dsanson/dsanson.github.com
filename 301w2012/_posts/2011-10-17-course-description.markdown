## Philosophy 301: Introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy

Winter 2012

This course is introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy, from the death of Aristotle in 322 BCE to its traditional beginning in 585 BCE. We will cover Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, and several presocratic philosophers, like Anaximander and Parmenides. We will focus on issues in natural philosophy and metaphysics.

We will meet MW 11:30-1:18, in Caldwell Lab 0120. We will probably have a couple of exams and two or three papers.
