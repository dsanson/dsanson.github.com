An introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy, from its traditional beginning in 585 BCE to the death of Aristotle in 322 BCE. We will cover several Presocratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Our focus will be on ancient views on the nature of reality, our knowledge of it, and our place in it. 

We meet MW 11:30-1:18, in Caldwell Lab 0120.
