As I mentioned today in lecture, we will not be spending time on the broader cultural context. Here are some suggestions for further reading in that direction.

For a standard and accessible overview of Ancient Greece, see

+   Thomas Martin (1996), *Ancient Greece* (ISBN: 0300084935)

The book I mentioned in class today is

+   Debra Nails (2002), *The People of Plato: A Prosopography of Plato and Other Socratics* (ISBN: 0872205649)

I won't try to provide a list of primary sources. But if you want a feel for Greek culture in general, you should try at some point in your life tackling some of:

+   Homer, Hesiod, Herodotus, Thucydides
+   Ancient Greek Plays (Aristophanes' "The Clouds" has a famous caricature of Socrates)
+   Ancient Greek lyric poetry (Andrew Miller, *Greek Lyric: An Anthology in Translation* is a good collection).

It's all good stuff, well worth your time.
