There are many useful resources for students of Ancient Greek Philosophy on the web. One is

+   Marc Cohen's [Philosophy 320](http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/index.html) course webpage (most especially, his [lecture notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/320Lecture.html))

If you know Greek, you will love

+   [The Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/)

The best standard reference work in philosophy as of now is

+   The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/)

It has several very good articles on topics related to ancient philosophy, and is the best way to get a quick but sophisticated overview of a given topic.

Another good resource is

+   The [History of Philosophy section](http://philosophy-compass.com/history-of-philosophy) of [*Philosophy Compass*](http://philosophy-compass.com/)

The next step is to start looking for journal articles on topics of interest. Two good places to start such a search are

+   [Philpapers.org](http://philpapers.org/)
+   [The Philosopher's Index](http://library.ohio-state.edu/record=e1000309~S7)

These can be overwhelming---a lot of articles have been written! If you are interested in pursuing some specific topic and would like a bit of guidance, let me know.
