I mentioned this [collection of not-quite right optical illusions](http://optillusions.tumblr.com/) in class.

Also, for a recent discussion of rivers and waters, inspired by Heraclitus, see Quine's article, "[Identity, Ostension, and Hypostasis](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2021795)" ([off-campus link](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/stable/2021795)).
