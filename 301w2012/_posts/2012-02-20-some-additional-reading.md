There are two additional bits I'd like you to read, one a fragment and one some fragments from a treatise attributed Aristotle.

## Diogenes the Cynic

[Diogenes Laertius], in his *Lives of the Philosophers* [VI 53], tells a story about an exchange between Plato and [Diogenes the Cynic]:

> Once Plato was discussing Forms and using the words *tableness* and
> *cupness*. Diogenes the Cynic said, "I can see a table and a cup,
> Plato, but tableness and cupness---no way." "That's to be expected,"
> replied Plato, "since you have eyes, by which tables and cups are
> seen, but the understanding by which tableness and cupness are
> discerned is something you don't have." 

This translation from Julia Annas, *Voices of Ancient Philosophy*, p. 254.

## Some Fragments of a Treatise Attributed to Aristotle

I have posted some fragments of Aristotle's "On Ideas" on [Carmen]. This is taken from Terence Irwin and Gail Fine (eds.), *Aristotle: Selections* (Hackett 1995). If you are already logged into Carmen, here is a [direct link] that should work; otherwise, you'll need to log into Carmen and navigate to the 301 webpage.
