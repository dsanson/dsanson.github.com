Present and evaluate the argument that Aristotle attributes to Anaximander in the following passage (passage 5.4 on page 35 of *Philosophy Before Socrates*):

> Some make the infinite [apeiron] this [namely, something aside from the elements], rather than air or water, so that the others are not destroyed by the one of them that is infinite. For they contain oppositions with regard to one another, for example, air is cold, water wet, fire hot. If any one of them were infinite, the rest would already have been destroyed. But as it is, they declare that the thing from which all come to be is different.

*Presenting* the argument requires that you clearly identify the premises of the argument, the conclusion of the argument, and explain how the conclusion is supposed to follow from those premises. If any of the premises are controversial, it also involves explaining why we should accept those premises, perhaps by providing additional arguments in support of those premises.

To *evaluate* the argument is to determine whether or not it is sound. Recall,

Soundness
:    An argument is *sound* just in case (a) it is valid and (b) all of its premises are true.

Validity
:   An argument is *valid* just in case it is impossible for all of its premises to be true and its conclusion false.

Given these definitions, there are two ways an argument can fail to be sound: it can fail to be valid, or it might have one or more false premises.

So first, you need to decide whether or not you think the argument is sound. If you do not, you need to decide whether you believe it is invalid or you believe that it has one or more false premises. If you think the argument is not sound because it is invalid, you need to clearly explain why, by your lights, the premises could all be true but the conclusion false. If you think the argument is not sound because it has one or more false premises, you need to clearly identify one of the premises that you think is false, and explain why it is false. If, on the other hand, you think the argument *is* sound, you should try to raise the strongest objection to the argument you can imagine---either a reason to think it is not valid or a reason to think that one of its premises is false---and explain why you think that objection fails.

You might find it useful, in thinking this through, to consider how Anaximenes or Heraclitus would respond to Anaximander's argument. You might also find it useful to re-read what McKirahan has to say about the passage. I do not intend that this be a research paper but an exercise in analysis. If you do rely on any sources---articles, books, webpages---be sure to cite them. (I don't care what citation format you use. In my own writing, I use the Chicago Author-Date system.)

The paper should be no more than 600 words. It should be double-spaced, with at least one inch margins on all sides. It should be in a reasonable 12 pt [serif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif) font (like Times or Cambria or Palatino or Garamond). Please include a word count.

Because you only have 600 words, you should pick you words carefully. You should be able to clearly state what work is being done by each paragraph in your paper, and what work is being done, within each paragraph, by each sentence.

The paper does not need an extended introductory paragraph. You are welcome (encouraged) to follow this model to start your paper,

> Anaximander argues that
>
> 1. Blah blah blah.
> 2. Blah blah blah.
> 3. Blah blah blah.
> 4. Therefore, blah blah blah.

(Please don't infer from this that Anaximander's argument has exactly 3 premises, or that any of the premises are properly expressed as 'blah blah blah'.)

We will not provide written feedback on drafts, but if you come to office hours with a draft, we will be happy to discuss the draft with you.

The paper is due on **Monday, January 23rd**, in class. **EMAIL SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED**.

Late papers will be penalized a third of a grade-point per day late: an A paper turned in 1 day late will get an A-, 2 days late, a B+, 3 days late, a B, 4 days late, a B-, and so on. Papers turned in after class on the 23rd will be treated as one day late. Late papers should be handed to one of us personally, or placed in David's mailbox in University Hall 350.
