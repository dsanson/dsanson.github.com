## About the Exam

The Midterm Exam will be on Monday, February 6th, in class. The exam will be closed book/closed notes. I will provide blue books.

The exam will have three parts: identification, short answer, and essay. Identification questions will consist of short distinctive quotes from the texts we have read, and you will be asked to identify the author or the figure whose views are being described. For example, you might be asked to identify the author of:

> On the eighth of the month geld the boar and loud-bellowing bull, but hard-working mules on the twelfth.

And you might be asked to identify the figure whose views are being described in:

> He said that the world is held up by water and rides like a ship, and when it is said to ‘quake’ it is actually rocking because of the water’s movement.

Short answer questions will be a mix of "fill-in-the-blank" style questions and questions that can be answered in one or two sentences, e.g.,

1.  According to _________, the earth rests on water.
2.  According to Empedocles, the elements are brought together by ______ and driven apart by _______.
3.  What, according to Empedocles, are the four elements?

All essay questions will be taken from the questions in this guide.

## Questions

Note: I will add a few questions about the *Phaedo* in light of what we cover in lecture on Monday, January 30th.

1. Thales and Anaximander both attempt to explain why the earth is at rest. Present both of their explanations, and assess their relative merits.

2. What are Aristotle's four causes? Give an example to illustrate each kind of cause.

3. In the following passage, Aristotle describes the roles played by matter:

    > For that of which all existing things are composed and that out of
    > which they originally come into being and that into which they finally
    > perish, the substance persisting but changing in its attributes, this
    > they state is the element and principle of things that are.... For
    > there must one or more than one nature out of which the rest come to
    > be, while it is preserved. (Aristotle, Metaphysics 1.3 983b6–18; PBS
    > 4.7)

    Unpack this account, giving examples to illustrate each of the roles.

4. Explain why, given Aristotle's account of matter, a table is not matter.

5. What, according to Aristotle, does Thales mean when he says that everything is water? What are some reasons that could be given in support of Thales' view, so understood?

6. What does 'arche' mean? What does 'apeiron' mean? What might it mean to say that the arche is apeiron?

7. Present and evaluate Anaximander's "Swamping Argument".

8. How, according to Anaximander, do opposing elements, like earth, water, air, and fire, arise from the arche? What are some reasons his account is problematic?

9. What law or principle, according to Anaximander, governs the universe? How might that work?

10. Explain how, according to Anaximenes, everything comes from air.

11. Compare and contrast Anaximenes view, that the arche is air, and Heraclitus view (on one interpretation), that the arche is fire.

12. What might Heraclitus mean when he says that "Fire is want and satiety" (PBS 10.85)?

13. Compare and contrast Anaximander and Heraclitus on the role and nature of Justice in explaining the harmony found in the cosmos.

14. Heraclitus seems to have said something about rivers. Three surviving fragments speak to this, but each seems to say something different: 

    > Upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again
    > different waters flow. (10.64)
    >
    > [It is not possible to step twice into the same river]. . . . It
    > scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes. (10.65)
    >
    > We step into and we do not step into the same rivers. We are and we
    > are not. (10.66)

    Explain how the view expressed by each fragment differs from the others.

15. How does Parmenides characterize the two "ways there are for thinking" ("routes of investigation there are to be thought of")? How are they contrasted with the "way of mortal opinion"?

16. What might Parmenides mean when he says "the same thing is for thinking and for being"?

17. Plato reports that Zeno argued that "if things that are are many, they must therefore be both like and unlike, but this is impossible. For unlike things cannot be like, nor can like things be unlike" (*PBS* 12.1). Present this argument, clearly identifying its premises and its conclusion. Is the argument sound?

18. Zeno claims that, if there are many things, then each thing is of unlimited size. Present and evaluate his argument for this conclusion.

19. Present Zeno's famous paradox, "The Stadium", and present Aristotle's solution to the paradox.

20. Explain the Aristotelian distinction between an infinite "in respect of extremities" and an infinite "in respect of divisibility".

21. Suppose a lamp is rigged to a switch, and the switch is designed to turn on after 1 second, off after 1/2 of a second, on after 1/4 of a second, off after 1/8 of a second, on after 1/16 of a second, and so on, each time waiting half as long as before. Is the lamp on or off after 2 seconds? Explain.

22. Explain Anaxagoras's view that everything is a mixture of all things, all the way down.

23. Explain Aristotle's concept of a homoeomerous thing, giving an example of something that is, and something that is not homoeomerous.

24. Explain Empedocles view that everything (other than the elements) is a mixture of the four elements, and how he might reply to Anaxagoras's worry: "How could hair come to be from what is not hair, or flesh from what is not flesh?" (*PBS* 13.10)

25. Explain how, according to Empedocles, the cosmos goes through stages, governed by Love and Strife.

26. When asked what the pious is, Euthyphro says, "the pious is to do what I am doing now, to prosecute the wrongdoer, be it about murder or temple robbery or anything else, whether the wrongdoer is your father or mother or anyone else" (5d). Socrates says this is not an answer to his question. Explain.

27. Euthyphro suggests that an action or man dear to the gods is pious while an action or man hated by the gods is impious. What problem is raised for this definition? Is it a genuine problem?

28. Socrates argues that

    > If something’s changed in some way or affected in some way, it’s
    > not changed because it’s a changed thing; rather, it’s a changed
    > thing because it’s changed. Nor is it affected because it’s an
    > affected thing; rather, it’s an affected thing because it’s
    > affected. (10b-c)
    
    Explain what this means, and how it applies to the case of loved things.

29. In the *Meno*, Socrates argues that nobody knowingly does bad things. Present and evaluate that argument.

30. In the *Meno*, Socrates claims to demonstrate that the slave boy in some sense already knew the Pythagorean theorem. Explain what he does, and evaluate his claim that what he does demonstrates this.
