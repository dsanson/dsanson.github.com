In **no more than** 1500 words, address one of the following two prompts.

1.  In the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues against certain sorts of
    explanatory claims, like the claim that Socrates is taller than
    Simmias by a head, or the claim that 8 is more than 10 because two
    had been added. He then praises a sort of explanation he says
    Anaxagoras promises but never gives. Finally, he defends two sorts
    of explanatory claims on the grounds that they are "safe", like the
    claim that Socrates is tall by partaking of Tallness itself, and the
    claim that Socrates is sick because he contains fever. Reconstruct
    and assess his reasoning and work through his examples (or your
    own). Consider how the sorts of explanations Plato discusses relate
    to Aristotle's doctrine that there are four sorts of causes, and
    that they complement each other rather than compete with each other.

2.  In the *Parmenides*, Parmenides argues that the theory of forms
    leads a regress: we introduce a form of Largeness, for example, to
    explain what all the large things have in common, but then we need
    to introduce a further form to explain what all the large things
    have in common with Largeness, and so on. Present and evaluate this
    argument. Consider both what someone committed to Plato's theory
    might say in response and how someone---like Aristotle---might
    modify the theory to avoid the problem.


We will not provide written feedback on drafts, but if you come to office hours with an outline or draft, we will be happy to discuss that draft with you.

The paper is due on **Wednesday, February 29th**, in class. **EMAIL SUBMISSIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED**.

Late papers will be penalized a third of a grade-point per day late: an A paper turned in 1 day late will get an A-, 2 days late, a B+, 3 days late, a B, 4 days late, a B-, and so on. Papers turned in after class on the 23rd will be treated as one day late. Late papers should be handed to one of us personally, or placed in David's mailbox in 350 University Hall.
