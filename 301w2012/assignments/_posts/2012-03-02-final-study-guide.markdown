About the Exam
--------------

The final exam is on Monday, March 12th, 11:30am–1:18pm, in our usual
lecture hall. The exam will be closed book/closed notes. Bring a pen or
pencil. I will provide blue books.

The exam is much like the midterm, though a bit longer. It has three
parts: identification, short answer, and essay. The exam is cumulative.
All essay questions will be taken from the questions in this guide or
the [midterm study
guide](/301w2012/assignments/midterm_study_guide.html).

Questions
---------

1.  Early in the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues that the soul must continue
    after death because opposites come from opposites. Present and
    evaluate this argument.

2.  In the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues that seeing two sticks as equal
    involves recollection from imperfect similars. Present and evaluate
    this argument.

3.  In the *Phaedo*, Socrates argues that certain familiar sorts of
    explanation are problematic. Present some of his examples, and
    explain why, according to him, they are problematic.

4.  According to Socrates in the *Phaedo*, the forms provided "safe but
    ignorant" explanations. Explain what he means and why he thinks it
    is true.

5.  According to Socrates in the *Phaedo*, fire provides "another safe"
    explanation. Explain what he means and why he thinks it is true.

6.  In the *Republic*, Socrates argues that the soul has three parts.
    Present and evaluate his argument.

7.  In the *Republic*, Socrates argues that the "lovers of sights and
    sounds" only have opinion, not knowledge. Present and evaluate his
    argument.

8.  Present the Allegory of the Cave, explaining what aspects of Plato's
    views it is intended to illuminate.

9.  Early in the *Parmenides*, Socrates expresses doubts about the
    existence of forms like Human and Mud. Why might one doubt that
    there are such forms?

10. In the *Parmenides*, Parmenides raises a dilemma for the theory of
    Forms, based upon the claim that each thing that partakes of a form
    either "gets a share of the form as a whole or as a part." Present
    and evaluate the dilemma.

11. Present and evaluate the Third Man argument, as it occurs in the
    *Parmenides*.

12. Explain Aristotle's distinction between homonymous, synonymous, and
    paronymous things, giving examples of each.

13. Explain Aristotle's distinction between things that are *said of*
    another thing and things are *in* another thing, and give examples
    of things that are said of but are not in some other thing, things
    that are in but not said of some other thing, and things that
    neither in nor said of any other thing.

14. Explain Aristotle's distinction between primary substances and
    secondary substances, giving examples. Why are both primary and
    secondary substances called substances?

15. Aristotle distinguishes four sentence forms: universal affirmative,
    universal negative, particular affirmative, and particular negative.
    Give examples of each.

16. Aristotle raises the following puzzle in the *Posterior Analytics*:

    > Do you or do you not know that every pair is even? When you say
    > you do, they produce a pair that you did not think existed and
    > hence did not think was even.

    What is the puzzle, and what is Aristotle's solution to the puzzle?

17. Aristotle claims that we have the innate potential to come to know
    universals via experience. Explain how he thinks that works.
