## Course Description ##

An introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy, from its traditional beginning in 585 BCE to the death of Aristotle in 322 BCE. We will cover several Presocratics, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Our focus will be on ancient views on the nature of reality, our knowledge of it, and our place in it.

## Requirements ##

One short (2 page) paper (worth 20%), a midterm exam (25%), one longer (5 page) paper (30%), and a final exam (25%). Active participation and engagement, in class and/or office hours, will also be considered in our final assessment and assignment of grades, but this is not something we will attempt to quantify.

The final exam is on Monday, March 12th, 11:30am--1:18pm, in our usual lecture hall.

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). Please include (a) "301" in the subject line of your email and (b) your full name somewhere in the body of your email.

## Academic Misconduct ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers---philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

The expected learning outcomes associated with these requirements are reproduced below. This course aims to achieve these outcomes through intensive reading and analysis of some ancient greek philosophical texts that arguably form the backbone of all subsequent western intellectual culture.
