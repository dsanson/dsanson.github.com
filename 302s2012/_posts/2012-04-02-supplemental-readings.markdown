Here are some additional readings related to the issues raised by our readings on the creation of the world, for those looking to explore further.

If you have some mathematical chops and are interested in thinking about the size of infinite sets, take a look at

+   Cantor, G. (1955). *Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers.* Dover Publications. <http://archive.org/details/contributionstot003626mbp>

For a terse contemporary introduction to the same material, see

+   Jech, Thomas, "Basic Set Theory", *The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). <http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/primer.html>

For a post-Kantian rehash of the same problems, see

+    Frederick Engels (1877). *Anti-Dühring*, Part I, Chapter V, "Time and Space". <http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/ch03.htm>

For a discussion of some recent attempts to revive some of these arguments, with citations to the literature,  see

+   Reichenbach, Bruce, "Cosmological Argument", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition) <http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmological-argument/#4>

On a contemporary treatment of sorts of puzzles raised by Ghazali's example of the man picking the dates, see

-   Ullmann-Margalit, E. and Morgenbesser, S. (1977). "Picking and
    Choosing." *Social Research*, 44:757--785.
    <http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&res_dat=xri:pao-us:&rft_dat=xri:pao:article:3313-1977-044-04-000010:1>

For some later medieval history of these issues, see

-   Normore, C. (1998). "Picking and Choosing: Anselm and Ockham on
    Choice." *Vivarium*, 36(1):23–39.
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568534982579378>

For a contemporary discussion that touches on issues closely related to Averroes' solution, see

+   Quine, W. V. (1956). "Quantifiers and Propositional Attitudes." *The Journal of Philosophy*, 53(5):177–187. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2022451>
