We will discuss Aquinas and (very briefly) Henry of Ghent on the eternity of the world. We will then move directly to Boethius. So for Wednesday, April 11th, read the first three books of the *Consolatio*.

The *Consolatio* is a challenging read. For one thing, it is literary in a way that our other readings are not, so it can be hard to abstract the line of argument from the text. Boethius provides (but does he endorse?) a helpful outline of the argument of the first three chapters at lines 30-35 of Book 3, Prose 12. (Each "chapter" of each book is divided into a section of prose and a section of poetry. So "Prose 12" refers to the prose section of chapter 12.) You might find it helpful, as you read, to think about how what is happening fits into that outline.
