Some things I've mentioned in class:

-   Zeno Vendler. (1957). "Verbs and Times." *The Philosophical
    Review*, 66(2):143â€“160. <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2182371>

-   Aristotle, Book I, Chapters 9 and 10 of the *Nicomachean Ethics*. A
    decent translation is here
    <http://www.constitution.org/ari/ethic_01.htm#1.9>. If you have it,
    you might instead look at the translation by Terence Irwin
    (available in various compilations published by Hackett, and also as
    a free-standing book).
