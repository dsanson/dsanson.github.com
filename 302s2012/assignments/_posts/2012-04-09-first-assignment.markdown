Ghazali presents an example (p. 153 of *BIMP*, "Suppose two similar dates in front of a man...") of man desiring a date, faced with two similar dates, but unable to take both, and claims that it shows us something about the nature of the will. Averroes argues that the case does not show what Ghazali says it shows (see the discussion that starts about halfway down the first column on p. 154, "In the second part he no longer concedes that this quality cannot exist in the human will...").

In 350 words or less (roughly one page), present Ghazali's example, what Ghazali thinks it shows, and how Averroes understands it instead.

The paper is due **at the beginning of class on Monday, April 16th**.

You can submit your paper in one of two ways:

Hardcopy
:   Double-spaced, in a legible serif font (e.g., Times,
    Garamond, Palatino, Cambria, ...), of ordinary size (e.g., 12 pt),
    with at least one inch margins on all sides, and a word count.

Electronic
:   You may also email me your paper, provided it is either
 
    a.  a PDF document formatted per the same rules given above, with a filename in this format `<lastname>-302-assn1.pdf` (i.e., `sanson-302-assn1.pdf`);
    b.  as the plain-text body of an email (if you need to indicate
        formatting or structure, use [markdown syntax][]; if you need to indicate formatting or structure not possible with markdown, send me a PDF instead).

    Your email must have the subject line: "302 - First Assignment"

Email can be fickle. I will try to reply promptly to emails that I receive, so you know that I have received them. Until I receive your email, the paper has not been turned in.
