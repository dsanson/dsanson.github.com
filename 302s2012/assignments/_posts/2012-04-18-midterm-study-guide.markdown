**QUESTIONS 21 THROUGH 25 HAVE BEEN REMOVED TO REFLECT OUR PROGRESS THROUGH THE MATERIAL IN LECTURE.**

The midterm is on Wednesday, April 25th, in class. It will be closed book and closed notes. I will supply blue books. Be sure to bring a pen or pencil.

The exam will be in three parts: Part I will contain a handful of multiple choice questions; Part II, a handful of questions that can be answered in less than two or three sentences; Part II, 3 or 4 essay questions that can be answered in around 2 pages of a bluebook. 

The essay questions will all be taken from this study guide. The short answer and multiple choice questions will all be related to questions on this study guide.

# Questions

1. Present Plato's account of how the world came to be and compare it with the account presented in Genesis 1. Both accounts can be interpreted temporally or atemporally. Explain what those two interpretations are, and how they differ.

2. Present and evaluate Aristotle's argument that, given what a now is, there can be no first now, so the world has always existed.

3. Present and evaluate Aristotle's argument that, given the conditions required for a motion, there can be no first motion, so the world has always existed.

4. According to Ghazali, it is contradictory to suppose that the past is infinite, because of facts about the ratio of past rotations of the sun to past rotations of the planets. Present his argument, and Averroes' response.

5. When discussing the claim, made by the philosopehrs, that "it is impossible that there should exist a cause of which the effect is delayed, when all the conditions of its necessitating, its causes and elements, are completely fulfilled," (*BIMP* p. 144), Ghazali claims that "this kind of impossibility is found not only in the necessary and essential cause and effect but also in the accidental and conventional," and then discusses the example of divorce. Explain the example, and what Ghazali thinks it shows.

6. Present and evaluate Ghazali's example of the man who picks a date, what he thinks it shows about our will, and what he thinks it shows about God's will.

7. Present and evaluate Averroes' account of the man who picks a date, what he thinks it shows about our will, and what he thinks it shows about God's will.

8. Aquinas argues that no creature exists necessarily. Present and evaluate his argument.

9. Aquinas argues that, given the way that God produces the world, he need not temporally precede the world, so there is no contradiction in supposing that God creates the world so that it always exists. Present and evaluate his argument.

10. Henry of Ghent argues that there is a contradiction in supposing that a contingent created thing was never without existence. Present and evaluate his argument.

11. In Book 2, Prose 4 of the *Consolation of Philosophy*, Lady Philosophy presents several arguments for the conclusion that the goods of fortune cannot bring happiness. Present and evaluate one of those arguments.

12. In Book 3, Prose 2 of the *Consolation of Philosophy*, Lady Philosophy claims that the highest good must "gather all goods within itself." What are some interpretations of what this might mean? Which of these interpretations do you find most plausible as an interpretation of what she meant, and why?

13. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that people who seek wealth do so because they believe it will make them self-sufficient, and they are wrong about this. Present and evaluate this argument.

14. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that Power = Self-Sufficiency = Venerability = Renown = Joy. Present and evaluate her argument for this conclusion, and explain what it might mean.

15. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that God must be totally full of the highest and perfect good. Present and evaluate her argument for this conclusion.

16. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that God must be identical to, rather than logically distinct from, the highest good. Present and evaluate her argument for this conclusion.

17. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that, for a man to be happy, he must attain divinity. Explain what she might mean by this, and evaluate her argument for this conclusion.

18. In the *Consolation*, Lady Philosophy argues that God is not only the source of the world, but the final purpose of the world, because everything strives to exist and be one. Present and evaluate this argument.

19. In the *Consolation*, Book V Prose 1, Lady Philosophy provides an analysis of chance events that does not involve any chancy causes. Present this analysis.

20. According to Lady Philosophy (Book V, Prose 2), "freedom does not exist equally in all", but exists to the highest degree in God and the angels, and to the lowest degree in vicious human beings. Explain this view.

21. ~~In Book V Prose 3, Boethius presents several arguments to show that divine foreknowledge is inconsistent with free will. Present and evaluate one of those arguments.~~

22. ~~In Book V Prose 4, Lady Philosophy imagines a dispute between sense and imagination, on the one hand, and reason, on the other, and says we should side with reason in this dispute. What is the dispute? What does she think it shows?~~

23. ~~According to Lady Philosophy, God knows future contingent events because they are present to him from eternity. Explain this view. Do you think it solves the problem? Why or why not?~~

24. ~~Present Boethius's definition of eternity, explain what it means, and explain the contrast between eternity and sempiternity.~~
