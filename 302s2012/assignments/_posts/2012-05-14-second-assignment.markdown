Write a paper addressing one of the following prompts, in 1000 words or
less (roughly three pages). The paper is due **at the beginning of class
on Wednesday, May 23rd**.

1.  Scotus presents several objections to the view, defended by Boethius
    and Aquinas, that God knows future contingents because the whole of
    time is present to eternity. Explain the view, present Scotus'
    objections, and evaluate their force.

2.  Anselm argues that Satan, after the fall, has freedom of choice,
    lacks the power to return to willing justice for its own sake, but
    continues to be morally responsible for everything he does. Explain
    why Anselm thinks this, and evaluate the force of the reasons he
    presents for this view.

You can submit your paper in one of two ways:

Hardcopy
  ~ Double-spaced, in a legible serif font (e.g., Times, Garamond,
    Palatino, Cambria, ...), of ordinary size (e.g., 12 pt), with at
    least one inch margins on all sides, and a word count.

Electronic
  ~ You may also submit your paper via the Carmen Dropbox, provided it
    is either a **PDF** document formatted per the same rules given
    above, or a **plain-text document** (preferably UTF-8 formatted in
    accordance with the [markdown syntax][]). Recent versions of
    LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and Microsoft Word allow export (or "saving
    as") in these formats. On Macs, any document that can be printed can
    instead by saved as a PDF, via the print dialog. Submissions in RTF, DOC,
    DOCX, ODT, etc., will not be accepted.

Hardcopy submissions are due in class. Electronic submissions are due
before class begins.
