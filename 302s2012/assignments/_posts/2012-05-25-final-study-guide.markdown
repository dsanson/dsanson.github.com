The final is on Tuesday, June 5th, from 1:30pm–3:18pm, in our usual
classroom. It will be closed book and closed notes. I will supply blue
books. Be sure to bring a pen or pencil.

The final, like the midterm, will be in three parts: Part I will contain
a handful of multiple choice questions; Part II, a handful of questions
that can be answered in less than two or three sentences; Part II, some
essay questions that can be answered in around 2 pages of a bluebook.

The essay questions will all be taken from this study guide **or the
midterm study guide**. The short answer and multiple choice questions
will all be related to questions on this study guide **or the midterm
study guide**.

Questions
=========

1.  In Book V Prose 3, Boethius presents several arguments to show that
    divine foreknowledge is inconsistent with free will. Present and
    evaluate one of those arguments.

2.  In Book V Prose 4, Lady Philosophy imagines a dispute between sense
    and imagination, on the one hand, and reason, on the other, and says
    we should side with reason in this dispute. What is the dispute?
    What does she think it shows?

3.  According to Lady Philosophy, God knows future contingent events
    because they are present to him from eternity. Explain this view. Do
    you think it solves the problem? Why or why not?

4.  Present Boethius's definition of eternity, explain what it means,
    and explain the contrast between eternity and sempiternity.

5.  Explain the distinction between the necessity of the consequence and
    the necessity of the consequent and why the one does not follow from
    the other.

6.  Explain Boethius's distinction between conditional necessity and
    simple necessity, giving examples.

7.  Present and evaluate Scotus's argument against the view that God
    knows everything by knowing the divine ideas.

8.  Present and evaluate one of Scotus's objections to the view that God
    knows everything because the whole of time is present to eternity.

9.  According to Anselm, truth is rectitude. Explain what this means,
    and how it applies to true and false sentences, and true and false
    things. Explain why, according to Anselm, there is a sense in which
    all things are true.

10. Explain why, according to Anselm, justice is not willing what what
    ought.

11. Explain why, according to Anselm, justice is not willing what one
    ought with an awareness of rectitude.

12. Explain why, according to Anselm, justice is not willing what one
    ought to will when one knows that it is what one ought to will.

13. Explain why, according to Anselm, justice is not willing what one
    ought to will and willing to be under that obligation.

14. Explain what justice is, according to Anselm.

15. Anselm argues that freedom of choice is not the power or ability to
    sin or not to sin. Present and evaluate his argument for this
    position.

16. According to Anselm, the "power to sin" does not lie in the thing
    that is able to sin, but in the thing that is able to tempt it into
    sin. Explain.

17. What, for Anselm, is freedom of choice? Does it require the ability
    to do otherwise? Why or why not?

18. Anselm argues that even God cannot take away one's freedom of
    choice. Present and evaluate his argument.

19. Anselm claims that God gave Satan both the power and will to receive
    perseverence, but he didn’t give perseverance to Satan because Satan
    didn’t receive it. Explain what that means, and how it could be,
    according to Anselm, that Satan didn't receive it, even though he
    was given both the power and will to receive it.

20. Anselm gives the example of a Miser who wills to retain his coin,
    but also wills bread, and gives up his coin in order to get the
    bread. What is this example supposed to show?

21. Anselm argues that an angel made apt to have a will, but not yet
    willing anything, cannot move itself to will something. Present and
    evaluate his argument.

22. Anselm argues that an angel that has only the will for happiness
    cannot move itself to will anything else. Present and evaluate his
    argument.

23. Anselm argues that an angel that has only the will for justice
    cannot move itself to will anything else. Present and evaluate his
    argument.

24. Why, according to Anselm, does Satan abandon rectitude? Why,
    according to Anselm, does the good angel remain upright? Why,
    according to Anselm, is the difference between Satan and the good
    angel spontaneous to Satan and the good angel, and not due to God.

25. Why, according to Anselm, is it impossible for Satan to move himself
    to return to willing justice for its own sake, after the fall? Does
    that mean that Satan no longer has the freedom of choice? Why or why
    not?

26. Why, according to Anselm, is it impossible for the good angel to
    fall, after Satan has fallen? Does that mean that the good angel no
    longer has freedom of choice? Why or why not?

27. Present one of Abelard's examples that is intended to show that sin
    does no lie in the performance of wicked deeds, and evaluate the
    force of the example.

28. Present and evaluate Abelard's reasons for thinking that sin is not
    vice.

29. Abelard argues that sin does not lie in the will, appealing to the
    example of the man who, after fleeing from his lord, eventually
    kills him in self-defense. Present and evaluate his argument based
    on this example.

30. According to Abelard, sin does not lie in having a bad character,
    performing bad acts, or having a bad will. In what does sin lie,
    according to Abelard, and how is that different from bad character,
    bad action, or bad will?

31. Present Abelard's distinction between good intentions, bad
    intentions, and neutral intentions, and explain why he thinks the
    bad ones are bad and why the neutral ones fail to be good and fail
    to be bad.

32. Aquinas thinks that we can evaluate both the inward act and the
    outward act on two separate dimensions, and that the complete
    goodness (or badness) of an act requires that it be good (or bad)
    along all dimensions. Use Aquinas's distinctions, evaluate the
    actions of the two men who, in Abelard's example, work together to
    hang a third.
