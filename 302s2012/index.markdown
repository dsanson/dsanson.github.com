A survey of the history of philosophy from Augustine to Ockham. We will
read primary texts by such figures as Augustine, Philoponus, Boethius,
Ghazali, Averroes, Avicenna, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas, Scotus, and
Ockham. The course will be structured around fourâ€¨topics: creation, free
will, material substance, and medieval theories of cognition. These
topics will take us into a cluster of fundamental issues in metaphysics,
epistemology, philosophy of mind, and ethics. Requirements will most
likely include two papers and one or two exams.

Monday and Wednesday, 1:30-3:18, Spring 2012.
