## Course Description ##

A survey of the history of philosophy from Augustine to Ockham. We will read primary texts by such figures as Augustine, Philoponus, Boethius, Ghazali, Averroes, Avicenna, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas,  Scotus, and Ockham. The course will be structured around four topics: creation, free will, material substance, and medieval theories of cognition. These topics will take us into a cluster of fundamental issues in metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and ethics.

## Texts ##

There are three required texts:

-   Boethius, *The Consolation of Philosophy*, translated by P.G. Walsh.
    Oxford University Press, 2008. ISBN: 0199540543
-   Anselm, *Three Philosophical Dialogues: On Truth, on Freedom of
    Choice, on the Fall of the Devil*, translated by Thomas Williams.
    Hackett Publishing, 2002. ISBN: 0872206114
-   Richard Bosley and Martin Tweedale (eds), *Basic Issues in Medieval
    Philosophy*, Broadview Press, 2006. ISBN: 1551117150

Additional readings and resources will be made available through the course website.

## Requirements ##

One short (2 page) paper (worth 20%), a midterm exam (25%), one longer (5 page) paper (30%), and a final exam (25%). Active participation and engagement, in class and/or office hours, will also be considered in our final assessment and assignment of grades, but this is not something we will attempt to quantify.

The final exam is on Tuesday, June 5th, from 1:30--3:18, in our usual lecture hall. <http://registrar.osu.edu/scheduling/SchedulingContent/SP12Finals.pdf>

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). Please include (a) "302" in the subject line of your email and (b) your full name somewhere in the body of your email.

## Academic Misconduct ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers---philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>
