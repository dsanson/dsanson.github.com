serif-style font (e.g., Times or Cambria).

Prompt
------

As Bargle points out, Argle’s initial position in “Holes”—that there are
no holes—seems like a nonstarter, given that there is swiss cheese.
Argle tries to account for swiss cheese without committing himself to
holes: explain clearly what his account is and why he thinks it doesn’t
commit him to holes. In “Holes”, Argle abandons the view that there are
no holes in the face of some problems raised by Bargle. What are those
problems? Do they show decisively that there are holes?
