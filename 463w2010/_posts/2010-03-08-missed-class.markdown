First, I’m sorry I missed class today without prior announcement. I
threw out my back yesterday and have been having trouble walking around.
We will have class on Wednesday, either to talk about modality or to
review the study questions.

Second, please remember to fill out the electronic SEIs for this course.
You can’t do this after this Friday, March 12th. I am untenured, and
these evaluations have an impact on my tenure decision, so they are
important, whether positive or negative.
