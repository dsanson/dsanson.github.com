The aim of this course is to explore various philosophical issues concerning God and his relation to the temporal world. These issues are of interest for many reasons:

+  They are a central part of the canon of traditional philosophical theology.
+  They bear directly on contemporary issues concerning the metaphysics of modality, the metaphysics of time, and free will.
+  They bear indirectly on contemporary debates concerning the relationships between atemporal objects (like numbers) and temporal objects (like mathematicians).

God is often said to be "outside of time". He is also supposed to be related to temporal things in many ways: he creates them, he loves them, he organizes them according to some providential plan, and he knows everything that happens to them, past, present, or future.

In this course, we will consider a variety of attempts to make sense of all or part of this traditional picture. We will likely discuss some of the following topics

+	Divine Eternity (What does it mean to say that God is eternal?)
+   Divine Knowledge of "Tensed Facts" (Does God know what time is is now?)
+	Divine Foreknowledge of Future Contingents (If God knows what will happen, must it happen?)
+   Divine Infallibility (Does God ever have false beliefs? Could he have false beliefs?)
+   Divine Deception (Does God ever deceive us? Could he deceive us?)
+   Divine Omnipotence (Can an omnipotent God change the past? the present? the future?)

On the flip side, we will discuss some of the following topics

+   Temporality (What does it mean for something to be temporal, as opposed to eternal?)
+   Tensed Facts and Cognition (What do we know when we know what time it is now?)
+   Future Contingency and Free Will (In what sense, if any, is the future contingent? What does this have to do with free will?)
+   The Necessity of the Past (In what sense, if any, is the past fixed or necessary?)

Readings will be drawn from both contemporary and medieval sources. Expect to read some Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham, some Molina; and some Kretzmann, Stump, Dummett, Geach, Freddoso, Lewis, and Brower.
