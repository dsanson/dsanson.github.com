Philosophical Issues concerning God and his relation to the temporal world. We will likely discuss

+	Divine Omnipotence
+	Divine Foreknowledge of Future Contingents
+	Divine Eternity

Questions to be considered may include: Can an omnipotent God create a stone that is too heavy for him to lift? Can an omnipotent God change the past? Can an omniscient God know what a free individual will do before they do it? Can God be mistaken? Can he be a deceiver? Can an eternal God stand in any relation to a temporal world?

Readings will be drawn from both contemporary and medieval sources.
