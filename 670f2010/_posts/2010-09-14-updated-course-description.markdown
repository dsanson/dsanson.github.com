Traditional western theism tells us that God is maximally great or perfect along at least three dimensions. He is

+   all-powerful (omnipotent)
+   all-knowing (omniscient)
+   all-good (omnibenevolent)

In addition to these three core attributes, it is often asserted that God is

+	simple
+	timeless
+	immutable
+	impassible

These attributes give rise to several philosophical puzzles. In this course, we will explore some of those puzzles.

The puzzles we will explore divide into three clusters: 

1.  The limits of omnipotence
2.  Omniscience and future contingency
3.  Eternity and temporality

## The limits of omnipotence

Here are some tasks that seem difficult to pull off: 

+   make it the case that 2 + 3 = 6.
+   make it the case that 2 + 3 = 5.
+   make a stone that is too heavy for an omnipotent being to lift.
+   make it the case that you were never born.
+   make it the case that someone else raise their arm of their own free will.

Here are some tasks that seem difficult to pull off if you happen to be perfectly good:

+   tell a lie.
+   create a world that is not the best world possible.

What should a defender of divine omnipotence say about such cases?

## Omniscience, future contingency, free will

If God is omniscient, then he knows what will happen in the future. But if he already knows what will happen in the future, then it seems that the matter is settled: it is too late for things to turn out otherwise.

Further, if it is too late for things to turn out otherwise, it is too late for you to make it the case that things turn out otherwise, which seems to imply that it is too late for you to exercise free will.

What should a defender of divine omniscience say about this?

## Eternity and temporality

An eternal being is outside of time. Such a being, it seems, can bear no temporary relations to temporal things. But God appears to bear all sorts of temporary relations to temporal things: he creates and (perhaps) destroys them, he hears their prayers, etc.

What should a theist say about this? 

## Background and foreground reading

A good place to start is the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu).

We will start with [omnipotence](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/). 

But poke around. There are good articles on [philosophy of religion](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-religion), [concepts of god](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god), [time](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time), [eternity](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity), [fatalism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fatalism), [medieval theories of future contingents](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/med-futcont/), [foreknowledge and free will](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge), [divine simplicity](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-simplicity), [free will](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill), ...
