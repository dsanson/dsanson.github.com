I spent a moment tweaking the javascript that enables or disables off-campus links (i.e., links via OSU's ezproxy server) to library-subscribed readings. The script now stores its setting in a cookie, so your choice should be persistent. And I've moved the button for toggling between direct links and off-campus links to the top right hand corner of every 670 page.
