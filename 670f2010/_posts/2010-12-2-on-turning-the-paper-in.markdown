## Precise Due Dates

The paper is due on Thursday of finals week. Let's say that it is due at **midnight** of Thursday of finals week.

If you are a graduating senior, you will need to get your paper in by **midnight** of Wednesday of finals week, so I can submit your grade by midnight on Thursday.

## Where to Put It

You can turn it in to my box in the department office. The department office closes around 5 pm. Or you can email it to me. If you email it to me, please:

+   include "670" in the subject
+   send the paper as a PDF file *or* cut and paste the content of the paper into the body of your email message.

Opening and printing ~20 papers in Word takes significantly longer than opening and printing ~20 PDF files.

## SEIs

A friendly reminder that they need to be filled out by this Sunday. Thanks.
