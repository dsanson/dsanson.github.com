# [Order off menu]

You are free---encouraged!---to design your own topic. If you want to do this, get me a brief outline or synopsis, indicating what you are going to be writing on and who you are going to be responding to, by next Tuesday, November 30th.

Your topic should be connected to something we discussed in class or something discussed in our readings. You are welcome to bring in outside sources---e.g., Hasker on middle knowledge or papers we didn't read on Omnipotence, etc.

# [Order off of the menu below]

You are also welcome to write on any one of the following topics. Note that some of these topics are less specific than others.

1.  Get to the bottom of Freddoso's account of the Molinist solution to the reconciliation problem (section 4.5).

2.  Present and evaluate the Molinist solution to the source question---the question of how God knows future contingents. Present what you consider to be the strongest objection to the view, and what a Molinist could or should say in response.

3.  Present and evaluate the Ockhamist (or an Ockhamist) solution to the reconciliation problem. Present what you consider to be the strongest objection to the view, and what an Ockhamist could or should say in response.

4.  Evaluate Geach's argument that making sense of prevention requires certain views about the future.

5.  Say something valuable and intelligent about the literature on omnipotence that we read, e.g., consider the conflict between those who seek to provide a limited definition of omnipotence and those who insist on absolute omnipotence and say something insightful about it; provide an insightful defense of some strategy for defining omnipotence that we rejected or ignored, etc.
