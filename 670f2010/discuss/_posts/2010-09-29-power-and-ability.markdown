Haley (right?) suggested that there might be an important different between *powers* and *abilities*, and wondered which of the two was relevant to omnipotence. In response, I mentioned two distinctions:

1.   active powers vs. passive powers

This is a contrast mentioned in our reading from Aquinas. A passive power (or potentiality) is a capacity to be affected in some way. So, for example, lead has different passive powers than glass, which is why, when struck by a hammer, lead dents and glass shatters. An active power is, by contrast, a power to affect things (either yourself or others). Aquinas claims that God is omnipotent with respect to *active*, but not *passive*, powers.

2.  ability vs. exercisable ability

That's an awkward label. Here is an example: Bonnie, my neighbors' cat, is able to climb trees. She is still able to climb trees when she is shut inside the house---she still has that ability---but she is in a situation such that she cannot exercise that ability.

I was re-reading [Hoffman and Rosencrantz's article](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/omnipotence/) on SEP, and noted that they mark this distinction as a distinction between ability and power:

> *Power* should be distinguished from *ability*. Power is ability plus opportunity: a being having maximal ability who is prevented by circumstances from exercising those abilities would not be omnipotent. Nothing could prevent an omnipotent agent from exercising its powers, if it were to endeavor to do so.

As I recall, Haley felt that this distinction was not quite what she had in mind. I'm sure there are other useful distinctions to be made in this area.
