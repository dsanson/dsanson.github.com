# Steven's First Email

We never really discussed the solution to the impeccability problem that I've found the most useful. I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

I generally use the definition of omnipotence that Swinburne puts forth in his little book, Is There a God? Thus, omnipotence is the power to bring about any logically possible state of affairs as a basic action. The strategy for getting out of all the puzzles is then to locate a contradiction within them. (I know you don't like the contradiction talk. I invite you to paraphrase as needed.)

Can God create a square circle? No, because the nature of squares and circles are contradictory (necessarily incompatible... whatever).

Can God create a rock so big that he can't lift it? No, because the nature of rocks (and all material objects for that matter) is such that they can always be moved.

Can God do evil? That depends. If God is only contingently good, then yes. If he is necessarily good, then no. Why? Because it is contradictory to say that a necessarily good being does something evil.

In other words, we don't need to build the stuff about God's nature into the definition of omnipotence to get around the impeccability problem, thus running into the McEar problem. We can instead look to the nature of God downstream when asking what is logically possible for God to bring about. It's similar to the problem of God bringing about a state of affairs such that he did not bring it about. That state of affairs itself is contradictory, since it would be a state of affairs that both is, and is not, brought about by God. In the impeccability case, assuming that God is necessarily good, the state of affairs where God does evil is one that both is and cannot be brought about by God (a necessarily good being).

Sorry we never got to this. If I teach this class again, I'll have a better grip on the literature and what is worth spending time on and what is not. I've appreciated your willingness to stick with it and help me out!

Suppose omnipotence is the power to bring about any logically possible state of affairs as a basic action.

Let P be some logically possible (and evil) state of affairs. Let God be necessarily good. Then there is some logically possible state of affairs, P, that God cannot bring about as a basic action. You point out that he cannot bring about P because it is logically impossible for a necessarily good being to bring P. But so what?

Perhaps you intend to say that omnipotence is the power S has to bring about any logically possible state of affairs P as a basic action, so long as it is logically possible that S bring about P as a basic action.

Now I understand the relevance of what you say in answer to "Can God do evil?" But then what of McEar?

I suspect you will run into similar problems when it comes to time---you will want to rely on some claim about what it is logically possible to *bring about*, but that is irrelevant given your definition.

Thoughts? David

Thanks for giving me a chance to think through this in class today. It was very interesting to me at least. Unfortunately, I'm still unsure exactly where things stand.

To recap the suggestion that I think I still like:

Define omnipotence as the power to bring about any accidentally possible state of affairs as a basic action. Then, deal with any potential objections to this definition downstream by getting clear about what exactly is possible.

I think the kind of power that's relevant to the discussion of omnipotence is the power to shape the future of the world. If that's right, then when we ask what actions are possible, present and past facts about the world need to be held fixed. Thus, it is no limit on anyone's power that she cannot change the past, or bring about the existence of a square circle. Some facts about the past or present can leak into the future, by narrowing the scope of the accidental possibilities. How this relates to God depends on what is true about God. Is he necessarily good? If so, then it will turn out not to be possible for certain kinds of evils to exist.

I'm still trying to understand your objection here. I take it that the general concern is along McEar lines, i.e. that it will be too easy to be omnipotent. Something like this then? Construct a world in which only a few measly things are accidentally possible, and imagine a being in that world who can do all of them. That being would be omnipotent given my definition, but he's also a weakling. Is that the idea?

Yeah, I'm confused too.

Here is one problem: suppose a being has the power to bring about any accidentally possible state of affairs *by accident*. Suppose, for example, that the past history of the world rules out the future existence of *really heavy stones*. It still feels like an omnipotent being should have the power to lift such stones if there were any.

One way around this would be to say something like: an omnipotent being has the power to bring about any accidentally possible state of affairs *and* would have that power even if the past were different. I don't think the counterfactual is quite what is wanted, but maybe it suggests the direction I'd want to go.

Here is another problem, expressed to parallel your reasoning above. Some facts about the past or present can leak into the future, by narrowing the scope of the accidental possibilities. How this relates to God depends on what is true about God. Is he (by his very nature) necessarily unable to bring about anything? If so, then it will turn out not to be possible for him to bring about anything. But he'll still be omnipotent.

Here it seems to matter that the constraint is due to something about God rather than something about the world: if the world is by its nature unmovable, perhaps we should not require that an omnipotent being be able to move it; but if a being is by its nature unable to move the world, then that being is not omnipotent.

Likewise, if the world by its nature is unable to sustain evil, perhaps we should not require that an omnipotent being be able to bring evil about; but if a being is by its nature unable to bring about evil, that seems to impugn its omnipotence.

One response to this would be to invoke some sort of maximality constraint, ala Flint and Freddoso. The being who can bring nothing about does not have the maximal powers that a being satisfying your definition could have. But then you have to face moral goodness straight on: it seems that a being that is perfectly good ipso facto does not have the maximal powers that a being satisfying your definition could have.
