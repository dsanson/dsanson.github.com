# Plan

We will aim to work through this material over three weeks. Who knows if we will make it. We'll see how it goes and what catches our interest.

Most of the readings are short. You might wish to read through
*everything* quickly to get a sense of the terrain, and then
re-read each article slowly in sync with our class discussions.

Some links will only work from on campus. If you are off campus,
you will need to access those links via the library's [EZProxy server](http://library.osu.edu/help/help-with-tools/ezproxy).
