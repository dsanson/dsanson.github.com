## Course Description ##

Traditional western philosophical theology tells us that God, in contrast to his creatures, is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good. It is often, though not invariably, added that he is simple, eternal and immutable, and impassible. These attributes raise several philosophical puzzles. We will focus on puzzles concerning omnipotence, omniscience, and eternity, with an eye to the more general question of how God---as understood by traditional philosophical theology---is related to the temporal world.

## Academic Misconduct  ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers--philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your **papers and assignments must be your own work**, and **all sources must be cited**. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

## Email ##

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment). Please include (a) "670" in the subject line of your email and (b) your full name somewhere in the body of your email.
