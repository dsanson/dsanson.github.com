## Course Description ##

Traditional western philosophical theology tells us that God, in contrast to his creatures, is all-powerful, all-knowing, and timeless. This raises several related puzzles, for example:

1.	Can an all-powerful God make contradictions true? 
2.	Can an all-powerful God change the past?
3.	Can an all-knowing God know what time it is? 
4.	Can an all-knowing God know what a free agent will freely choose to do before she chooses to do it?
5.   Can a timeless God be related to temporal things? (If he can, does that 
6.	Can a timeless God be a creator of temporal things?
7.	Can a timeless God be a lover of temporal things?

In this course, we will explore some of these puzzles.

Readings will likely be drawn from both contemporary and medieval sources. Expect to read some Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham, some Molina; and some Kretzmann, Stump, Dummett, Geach, Freddoso, Lewis, and Brower.


## Required Texts ##

## Requirements ##

TBA: probably a few papers.

## Academic Misconduct  ##

You are encouraged to discuss the course material with your peers--philosophical conversation is one of the best ways to get better at doing philosophy. But your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

Email is the best way to reach me. However, I am not always online. Please allow me 48 hours to respond. If I have not responded in 48 hours please email me again, letting me know it is your second email (I won't take this as harassment).
