# Philosophy 700: First Year Seminar

David Sanson and William Taschek

Fall 2011

# Readings

The required reading for this course consist in (i) a selection of 10
Primary Texts, organized into three modules, (ii) a strong
recommendation that you explore relevant supplementary readings—some
*examples* of which are provided below, and (iii) the weekly discussion
essays and reaction papers. Each week we will focus on a different
Primary Text. A copy of each of the Primary Texts is available as a PDF
on the Carmen site for this course.

You are expected to come to class having thoroughly read and carefully
studied the Primary Text that is the focus of any given meeting—and
prepared to actively participate in the class discussion. You are also
expected to explore at least some supplementary readings and to have
read and reflected upon the weekly discussion essays and circulated
reaction papers.

# Assignments

In addition to keeping up with the assigned reading (primary texts,
seminar discussion papers, reaction papers), exploring relevant
secondary texts, and actively participating in class discussion, each
student will be required to complete the following:

-   **Two** *seminar discussion papers*. These papers are intended
	to be substantive critical discussions/evaluations of some
	aspect of the primary text that is assigned for a given week.
	They should be about 7-10 pages long. You are to distribute them
	via email as attached documents to the whole class a couple of
	days before the day on which the primary text at which they are
	directed is assigned. We strongly suggest that you discuss the
	direction you plan to take in this paper with at least one of us
	before you submit it.

-   **Two** *comments on discussion papers*. The idea here is for
	you to assume something like the role that the "commentator"
	assumes in an APA session—presenting a brief critical evaluation
	of the principal arguments/positions defended in the relevant
	discussion paper. Your primary aim is to generate discussion not
	only of the seminar discussion paper but, importantly, of the
	primary text as well. Your comment and discussion should take up
	about an hour (or a bit more) of the seminar period. Though not
	required, a handout of some sort might sometimes be helpful.

-   **Five** one to two page *reaction papers*—either on the primary
	reading for a given week or on that week’s discussion paper.
	These are to be posted to the whole class no later than 5PM on
	the day before the seminar meeting. No more than two of your
	reaction papers can focus on material from any one of our three
	modules.

-   A substantial, 15-25 page *seminar paper*. This can either be a
	significant expansion and refinement of one of your presentation
	papers or something completely new. In any case, before you
	start on this paper, you should discuss your plans with one or
	both of us. And, needless to say, you may want to consult with
	us in the course of writing the paper as well. If you are
	writing on a topic distinct from one of your two presentation
	papers, we will also be willing to comment on a *complete* draft
	of it (but not on notes toward a draft!), if it is turned into
	us sufficiently in advance.
