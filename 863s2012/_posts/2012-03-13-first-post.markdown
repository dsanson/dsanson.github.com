A seminar on the metaphysics of modality. I have not quite settled on
the overall structure of things yet. A draft of the [syllabus][] is
posted. I'd like to look at some of the recent literature on counterpart
theory and the Humphrey objection, some of the recent literature on
"advanced modalizing", and perhaps some of the literature on modality
and essence. I suspect we will begin by reading *On the Plurality of
Worlds*, which I have ordered from the bookstore. If you want a sense of
where I am coming from on some of these issues, take a look at "Maximal
Possibilities" and "Worlds Enough for Junk", both available from my
[research page][].
