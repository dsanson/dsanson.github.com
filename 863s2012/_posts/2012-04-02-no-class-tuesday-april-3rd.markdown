Just a reminder that we have no class tomorrow, Tuesday, April 3rd, as I will be in Seattle. For next week, try to make your way through the first section of readings. I recommend the following order of attack:

+   Lewis, chapter 1
+   Lewis, excerpt from *Counterfactuals*
+   Yagisawa
+   Bricker
+   Lewis, chapter 2
+   McDaniel
+   Dorr

I plan to start our discussion where our last discussion left off: Isolation, Island Universes, Spirit Universes, and the Possibility of Nothing. On the Possibility of Nothing, you might take a look at 

-   David Efird and Tom Stoneham, (2005). "Genuine Modal Realism and the
    Empty World", *European Journal of Analytic Philosophy*, 1(1):21â€“37.

I put a copy in the Dropbox folder. This is the first of several papers they have written together on this topic, and the one that most directly engages with Lewis's own worries on the issue.
