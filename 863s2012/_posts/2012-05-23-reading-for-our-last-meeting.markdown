I am going to be self-indulgent, and have us talk about three papers next week on essence and existence, rather than advanced modalizing:

-   Adams, Robert. 1989. "Time and Thisness." In *Themes from Kaplan*,
    ed. Joseph Almog, John Perry, and Howard Wettstein. New York: Oxford
    University Press.
-   Almog, Joseph. 1991. “The What and the How.” *Journal of Philosophy*
    88: 225–244.
-   ———. 2003. “The Structure-In-Things: Existence, Essence and Logic.”
    *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*.

I've put copies of each in the dropbox folder.
