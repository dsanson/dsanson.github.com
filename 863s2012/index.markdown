title: Philosophy 363 Modality

A seminar on the metaphysics of modality. I have not quite settled on
the overall structure of things yet. I'd like to look at some of the
recent literature on counterpart theory and the Humphrey objection, some
of the recent literature on "advanced modalizing", and perhaps some of
the literature on modality, essence, and metaphysical dependence. I
suspect we will begin by reading *On the Plurality of Worlds*, which I
have ordered from the bookstore. If you want a sense of where I am coming from on some of these issues, take a look at "Maximal Possibilities" and "Worlds Enough for Junk", both available from my [research page](/research).

Tuesdays 3:30-6:18, Spring 2012.
