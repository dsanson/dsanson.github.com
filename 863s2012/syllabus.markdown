Course Description
------------------

This will be a seminar on modal metaphysics, loosely organized around four topics:

1.  Possible worlds;
2.  Counterpart theory and the Humphrey objection;
3.  Advanced modalizing;
4.  Essence and modality.

Along the way, we will read all of *On the Plurality of Worlds*.

### Possible Worlds

What are possible worlds, why do we need them, and what do they have to do with modality? These familiar questions tend to structure much of the literature on modality, so we will begin with them.

### Counterpart Theory and the Humphrey Objection

According to counterpart theory, to say that Humphrey could have won the
election is to say that someone similar to Humphrey in some similar
election in some possible world. In a famous footnote in *Naming and Necessity*, Kripke objects:

> Probably, however, Humphrey could not care less whether someone
> *else*, no matter how much resembling him, would have been victorious
> in another possible world.

Many have thought that there is something deeply right about what Kripke
says. Others have thought that there is something deeply wrong about
what Kripke says. Either way, it's worth thinking about.

### Advanced Modalizing

Advanced modal claims are modal claims about possible worlds or the
possible worlds framework, like the claim that the only possible worlds
that could exist are the possible worlds that do exist. It is not clear
whether or not such claims make sense, and, if they do, how to make
sense of them.

### Essence and Modality

Fine's "Essence and Modality" (1994) revitalized an old distinction between *essence* and *necessity*. Necessarily, Venus is distinct from Saturn, but, Fine says, it is no part of Venus's essence---no part of what it is to be Venus---that Venus is distinct from Saturn. So not all necessary properties are essential properties. And, taking things a step further, Fine suggests a reduction of all necessity to essence.

Academic Misconduct
-------------------

Your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will
report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic
misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more
guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at

Disabilities
------------

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a
disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will
work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for any student with a documented disability.
