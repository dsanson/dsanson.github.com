Course Description
------------------

A seminar on modal metaphysics, loosely organized around four topics:

1.  Possible Worlds
2.  Counterpart theory and the Humphrey objection;
3.  Advanced modalizing;
4.  Essence and modality.

### Possible Worlds

What are possible worlds and why do we need them? 

### Counterpart Theory and the Humphrey Objection

According to counterpart theory, to say that Humphrey could have won the
election is to say that someone similar to Humphrey in some similar
election in some possible world [@lewis1968]. @kripke1980 [p. 45]
famously objects:

> Probably, however, Humphrey could not care less whether someone
> *else*, no matter how much resembling him, would have been victorious
> in another possible world.

Many have thought that there is something deeply right about what Kripke
says. Others have thought that there is something deeply wrong about
what Kripke says. Either way, I think its worth thinking about.

### Advanced Modalizing

Advanced modal claims are modal claims about possible worlds or the
possible worlds framework, like the claim that the only possible worlds
that could exist are the possible worlds that do exist. It is not clear
whether or not such claims make sense, and, if they do, how to make
sense of them. Thinking about this helps to bring out some questions
about what is and is not fundamental, when it comes to modality, and I
think those questions are worth thinking about.

### Essence and Modality

@fine1994 revitalized the old distinction between substantial form
(essence) and proper accident (necessary but non-essential property).
The substantial form of a thing is its essence or real definition, the
account of what it is. A proper accident is a feature a thing has of
necessity, in virtue of its substantial form, that is not part of its
substantial form. So,

-   essence: a human is a rational animal
-   proper accident: a human is risible (has the capacity to laugh)
-   essence: a triangle is essentially a three-sided polygon
-   proper accident: the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180
    degrees.

@fine2002a suggests that we can explain *all* necessities by appeal to
essences. I think this is something worth thinking about.

Required Text

I've ordered,

-   Lewis, David. 1986. *On the Plurality of Worlds*. Oxford: Blackwell.

Additional readings and resources will be made available via a shared

A seminar paper, maybe presentations.

Academic Misconduct
-------------------

Your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will
report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic
misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more
guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at

Disabilities
------------

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a
disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will
work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable
accommodations for any student with a documented disability.
