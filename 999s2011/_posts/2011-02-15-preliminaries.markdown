A [syllabus](/999s2011/syllabus) is now posted. You can see that I've settled on the "seminar" format described in my earlier email. Requirements for the course are:

1. One dissertation abstract
2. One turn as presentator
3. One turn as commentator
4. Regular participation

These requirements are negotiable on a case-by-case basis.

There look to be between 11 and 14 of us, give or take, and there are only 10 weeks in the quarter. So we'll have to double-up. We have 2 hours and 50 minutes each week, and we'll want a 10 minute break, so that means that you'll get 1:20 minutes each. 

This also means we will meet 6 or 7 times, rather than 10.
