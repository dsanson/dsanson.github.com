It is not to early to begin thinking about what you should present. I'm happy to talk to you about this if you'd like. You should definitely talk to your advisor about it.

Some suggestions:

Writing Sample
  ~  If you plan to go on the market next fall, it is not too early to begin thinking about your writing sample. Typically, your writing sample is derived from a chapter in your dissertation. You should seriously consider taking this opportunity to begin the process of packaging that chapter into a free-standing piece.

Publication
  ~  Even if you are not going on the market next fall, it is not too early to submit an article to a journal. Students that have a publication do much better on the job market than those that do not. You should seriously consider taking this opportunity to begin the process of packaging some chunk of your research into publishable form.

Forward Progress
  ~  Sometimes, the most important thing to do is to push forward on the dissertation itself. Packaging up a writing sample or publishable article out of prior work often involves reworking stuff you have already done. So you should seriously consider taking this opportunity to push out a first draft of an entirely new chapter, or to finish off a chapter that exists only in the roughest form.
