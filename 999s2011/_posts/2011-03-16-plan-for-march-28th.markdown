The plan for our first meeting, on March 28th:

+   12:30-12:45: Organizational matters
+ 	12:45-?: Discuss placement with Ben Caplan

Ben says that he'll have some things to say, and it would be **good if you all had questions for him**, too.

Here is what's on my radar by way of organizational issues:

+ 	Nail down any lingering issues with the schedule (at the moment, we have two presenters without commenters and one commenter without presenter; also, I know some of you have time conflicts...)

+ 	Nail down page limits for the papers that we'll all have to read. (Does 20 pages sound right? 25?)

+ 	Nail down the advance time needed between getting us the papers and presentations (the syllabus says Friday before: is that enough time)?

+  	Figure out how we want to handle abstracts. I vote for devoting a small amount of time on this, at the end of each discussion period. Perhaps the commenter should also be tasked with providing some written comments on the abstract?
