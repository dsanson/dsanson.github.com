As we decided on Monday, April 11th, we will meet on May 23rd. Robby will present. ~~Ali will also present---if she is up for it; if not, Owen and Steve will use the second half of the seminar to run a (voluntary) session on how to set up a professional web page with an eye to the job market.~~

I've added two slots to the sign up sheet. Please don't use them unless you are Robby or Ali.
