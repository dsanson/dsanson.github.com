I've created an [online sign up sheet](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/philosophy). ~~For the moment, I've only opened up the slots for the first two meetings, April 4th and 11th. (We will have a brief organizational meeting on March 28th.)~~ This way, those who want to "lock in" an early date, either as presenter or commentator, can, and they can start planning ahead now.

Edit: All slots now open. Meeting on March 28th will include Ben Caplan and so won't be quite so brief.

Some notes on this: 

1. I've never used this online service before, but it gets good reviews. Let me know if you run into trouble.
2. It should be possible to "swap" slots on the sign-up sheet (if you can find someone who wants to swap with you).
3. While of course we admire the fact that you are always online (doing research, right?) and so were able to snatch up the very best slots before anyone else had a chance, if someone else needs that slot more than you, you'll give it up, right?
