Writing a good dissertation in philosophy is in large part a matter of doing philosophy well. But it is also part organizational challenge and part good writing. Here are four books that help on those two fronts.

+   Zerubavel, Eviatar. 1999. *The Clockwork Muse: A Practical Guide to Writing Theses, Dissertations, and Books*. Harvard University Press.

This is about how to organize your life around the project of producing a lengthy academic treatise.

+   Strunk, William, and E B White. *The Elements of Style*.

I assume you've all read *Elements*. If you haven't read it recently, it is worth re-reading on occasion. It is short and fun and invariably has an immediate impact on how you write. But *Elements* is unreliable, and it is long on dogmatic pronouncement and short on reason. 

+   Johnson, Edward. 1991. *The Handbook of Good English*. Washington Square Press.

*The Handbook of Good English* is reliable, long on reason, and short on dogmatic pronouncement. But it is not short or fun and will have less of an immediate impact on how you write.

+   Sullivan, K D, and Ann Longknfe. 2002. *The Art of Styling Sentences*. Barronâ€™s.

*The Art of Styling Sentences* is more limited in scope that *Elements* and *The Handbook*: it is a practical guide to the proper use of 20 complex sentence structures. It is short and can make an immediate impact on how you write.

I have copies of all four books in my office that you are welcome to borrow.
