## Course Description ##

This is a support group for people who meet two conditions:

1. They are crazy enough to try to write a dissertation in Philosophy.
2. The OSU Philosophy Department is crazy enough to let them do it.

## Requirements ##

1. One dissertation abstract
2. One turn as presentator
3. One turn as commentator
4. Regular participation

### Abstract ###

This is a good exercise---it helps you focus on the big picture and gives you a chance to think about the overall structure and aims of your project. It will also help us understand where you are coming from. And when you go on the market, it is something you need to produce: a comprehensible and catchy abstract is a vital part of your dossier. 

First draft due **Monday, April 4th** (week two) or the **Friday before you present** (which ever comes **first**).Everyone will have a chance to provide feedback on everyone's abstract. Expect to go through several revisions.

### Presentator ###

You will distribute some chunk of your work to everyone **no later than the Friday before you present**. Someone is assigned to comment. She opens discussion by *briefly* (3-5 minutes!) raising a couple of points for further discussion. You are given a chance to respond. We spend the rest of the time allotted discussing your work.

### Commentator ###

See above. Please **do not sink a lot of time and effort into this**. Take some notes as you read the paper, spend a few minutes looking over those notes and gathering your thoughts, and formulate a couple questions or puzzles to help us get discussion going. That's all.

### Participation ###

For this to work, everyone needs to read the piece that is sent around ahead of time, and everyone has to come ready to talk about it.

### A Note about Requirements ###

This class really is about supporting your work. I don't want it to get in the way. So all of these requirements (except participation!) are negotiable. Talk with me (or your advisor) about what you want (or need) to get out of this, and we can tailor your requirements to fit those ends.

### Special Note for Those Going on the Market Next Fall ###

Now is the time to start thinking about writing samples. Use this as an occasion to do so. Give us **a draft of your writing sample**. Don't have a draft of your writing sample? **Now** is the time to start working on one. Talk to your advisor and figure it out. Typically, this will mean taking some chunk of your disseration and making it into a self-standing paper. **Now** is the time to start doing that.

Martin Luther King, Jr. plagarized large chunks of his dissertation. Maybe that was because nobody ever remembered to put the required clause about academic misconduct into a syllabus that was directly connected to the dissertation he was writing?

## Academic Misconduct  ##

Your papers must be your own work, and all sources must be cited. I will report offenders to the committee on academic misconduct. Academic misconduct can take on many forms: if you are confused, or need more guidance on this issue, ask. If you have not already, take a look at <http://oaa.osu.edu/coam/faq>

## Disabilities ##

If you need (or may need) an accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact me **now** to discuss your needs. I will work with the Office for Disability Services to coordinate reasonable accommodations for any student with a documented disability. <http://www.ods.ohio-state.edu/current-students/>

## GEC Categories ##

This course will not contribute to your general education in any way at all. Sorry.
