<p>I am an assistant professor of philosophy at <a href="http://philosophy.illinoisstate.edu/">Illinois State University</a>. I'm primarily a metaphysician, but I also have research projects in the history of philosophy. A chunk of my current research focuses on the unreal: the past and future, the merely possible, and the fictional. A related chunk focuses on temporal instability (change) and modal instability (contingency). Another related chunk focuses on the indices we use to navigate the contingent, the temporary, the local, and the fictional: worlds, times, and places (the indices for fiction are controversial: perhaps they are contexts or interpretations or fictional realms). Also, I work on the history of the Liar Paradox in the Medieval Arabic tradition, and I am working on a paper on Boethius and divine foreknowledge.</p>
<p>I have broad philosophical interests, extending well beyond my active areas of research. These include interests in philosophy of action, philosophy of religion, and the intersection of metaphysics and value theory.</p>

If I were the person I'd like to be, I'd instead be playing with my daughter, <a href="http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morelfinds.html">collecting wild mushrooms</a> and messing around in boats: specifically, guerilla camping from my <a href="http://www.poucher-boote.de/index.php?rz85">East German folding kayak</a>.</p>
