I am an assistant professor of philosophy at the Ohio State University. I'm primarily a metaphysician, but I dabble in history on the side. A chunk of my current research focuses on the unreal: the past and future, the merely possible, the imaginary, the fictional, the ideal. A related chunk focuses on temporal instability (change) and modal instability (contingency). I've also done some work on the history of the Liar Paradox.

When not working, I am probably playing with [my daughter](http://flickr.com/photos/davsans/tags/hazel/), working in the garden, or watching TV. If I were the person I'd like to be, I'd instead be [collecting wild mushrooms](http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morelfinds.html) and guerilla camping from my [East German folding kayak](http://www.poucher-boote.de/index.php?rz85).
