I am an assistant professor of philosophy at the Ohio State University. I'm primarily a metaphysician, but I dabble in history on the side. A chunk of my current research focuses on the unreal: the past and future, the merely possible, the imaginary, the fictional, the ideal. A related chunk focuses on temporal instability (change) and modal instability (contingency). A related chunk focuses on the indices we use to navigate the contingent, the temporary, the local, and the fictional: worlds, times, places, and stories. I also do some work on the history of the Liar Paradox, especially in the Medieval Arabic tradition. And I have broad interests in the history of metaphysics, the history of logic and semantics, philosophy of action, and value theory.

When not working, I am probably playing with [my daughter](http://flickr.com/photos/davsans/tags/hazel/), working in the garden, watching TV, or messing around on a computer. If I were the person I'd like to be, I'd instead be playing with my daughter, [collecting wild mushrooms](http://morelmushroomhunting.com/morelfinds.html) and messing around in boats: specifically, guerilla camping from my [East German folding kayak](http://www.poucher-boote.de/index.php?rz85) along the Olentangy River.
