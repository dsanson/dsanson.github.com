## Site design ##

The design of this site is my own. But I began by taking a careful look at [Mark Reid's site](http://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name), and the bones of this site's design continue to owe a lot to his design.

## Software used to host this site ##

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (a lightweight CMS)

## Services used to host this site ##

* [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) (an inexpensive pay-as-you-go bare-bones webhost)
* [Github](http://github.com/) hosts both a [mirror](http://dsanson.github.com) of this site and a backup of its [source](http://github.com/dsanson/dsanson.github.com).
* [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) manages comments.
* [H2VX Contacts Conversion Service](http://h2vx.com/vcf/) converts the hcard on the index page to a downloadable vcard.
* [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) provides avatars for commenters and the image on my [about me](/about-me) page.
