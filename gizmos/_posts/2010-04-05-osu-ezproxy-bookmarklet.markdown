This "[bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)" allows for easy access to OSU-restricted resources from off-campus, via the OSU EZProxy service. To use, drag this link -- <a class="bml" href="javascript:location.href=location.href.replace(/(http:\/\/.*?)\//,%22$1.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/%22)">OSU Proxify</a> -- to your browser's bookmark toolbar. When you arrive at a site that requires the proxy, like [this article on jstor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3748616), click on the bookmarklet, and you will be redirected to [the proxified version](http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/stable/3748616) of the site's url (you will be asked to login first).
