This is not the [official calendar](http://philosophy.osu.edu/news/colloquia/default.cfm) for our department colloquia. This is an unofficial google calendar which I maintain for my own use. It differs in content from the official calendar in a few important ways:

1. I (try to) include *all* philosophy-related talks at OSU, not just official colloquia.^[We are now doing more of this with our official calendar, too.]
2. I (try to) include talks as soon as they've been scheduled.^[We try to do this with the official calendar too, but the process involved in updating the page currently means that there is often a delay.]

It differs in functionality in a few important ways as well:

1. You can [subscribe to it](webcal://www.google.com/calendar/ical/pgpbqbvg98d0a0opno8n688tsc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) within Google Calendar, iCal, Outlook, and the like. When events change, those changes should be reflected in your calendar.

2. You can [subscribe to it](http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/pgpbqbvg98d0a0opno8n688tsc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic) within an RSS feed reader, like Google Reader, NetNewsWire, newsbeuter, and the like. When events are added, you should get a post indicating the addition. (Unfortunately, it seems that when events are edited, this does not generate a new post, so this is not as useful as it could be.)

Let me know if there is a talk that I should add or if you notice any mistakes. And **let me know if you'd like to have the power to add talks yourself** (that's in bold because nobody has ever taken me up on it, and I wish people would).
