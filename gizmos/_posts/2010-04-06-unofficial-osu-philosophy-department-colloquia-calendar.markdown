This is not the [official calendar](http://philosophy.osu.edu/news/colloquia/default.cfm) for our department colloquia. This is an unofficial google calendar which I maintain for my own use. It differs from the official calendar in a few important ways:

1. I (try to) include *all* philosophy-related talks at OSU, not just official colloquia.
2. I (try to) include talks as soon as they've been scheduled.

Let me know if there is a talk that I should add or if you notice any mistakes.
