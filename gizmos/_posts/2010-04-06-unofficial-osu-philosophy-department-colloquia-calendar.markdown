The unofficial OSU philosophy department colloquia calendar has [become quasi-official](http://philosophy.osu.edu/department-resources), and I no longer maintain it.

You might also be interested in subscribing to the [OSU Events Calendar](http://icalshare.com/calendars/507), maintained by [Ted Pavlic](http://www.tedpavlic.com/). It tracks important dates on the academic calendar and university holidays: the sort of thing that the university ought to provide in a convenient format, but doesn't.
