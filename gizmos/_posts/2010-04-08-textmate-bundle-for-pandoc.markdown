I've thrown together a [Textmate bundle for Pandoc](http://github.com/dsanson/Pandoc.tmbundle). From the README:

> This bundle is a work in progress. It has many warts, and it is far from complete. It is idiosyncratic in ways that it shouldn't be. Some commands are probably broken.
> 
> I suspect anyone who uses Pandoc with Textmate will want a bundle tweaked to suit their own needs, and that many of us have already rolled our own sets of simple commands. I have two goals for this bundle, which aren't entirely compatible:
> 
>    1. To provide a reasonable set of commands and options to help get new users started.
>    2. To provide a way for users to share commands and options that they've come up with.
> 
> This probably means that the bundle should eventually be organized into "basic" and "advanced" sections.
> 
> Fixes, forks, improvements, ideas, complete overhauls, all welcome.
