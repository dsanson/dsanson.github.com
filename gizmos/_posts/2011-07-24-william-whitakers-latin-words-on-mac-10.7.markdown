   The official OS X version of [William Whitaker's Words](http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm) doesn't work with OS X 10.7 (Lion). So I've recompiled from source.

The official OS X version of [William Whitaker's Words](http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm) doesn't work with OS X 10.7 (Lion). A google search indicates that William Whitaker, the creator the software, [passed away in 2010](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mywesttexas/obituary.aspx?n=william-whitaker&pid=147336402).

Thankfully, the program is open source. So I've recompiled it as a universal binary:

+	[Command Line Only Version of Words](https://github.com/dsanson/Words/blob/master/binaries/MAC/words-os-x-universal.zip?raw=true)

Source for the official GUI is not available. But Erik Mendoza has updated his GUI wrapper, 

+	[Interpres.app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/),

to include my new binary.

~~If you want a GUI version, try this:~~

+	~~[Unofficial Hacked Copy of Interpres.app for 10.7](http://files.davidsanson.com/Interpres.app.zip)~~

~~(Interpres.app is GUI wrapper around Words, written by Erik Mendoza. The official version, which does not work with Lion, is available [here](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/).)~~
