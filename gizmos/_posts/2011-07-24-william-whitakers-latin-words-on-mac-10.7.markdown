The official (abandoned?) OS X version of [William Whitaker's Words](http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm) doesn't work with OS X 10.7 (Lion). So I've recompiled from source:

+	[Command Line Only Version of Words](http://files.davidsanson.com/words-os-x-universal.zip)

Source for the official GUI is not available. But Erik Mendoza has updated his GUI wrapper, 

+	[Interpres.app](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/),

to include my new binary.

~~If you want a GUI version, try this:~~

+	~~[Unofficial Hacked Copy of Interpres.app for 10.7](http://files.davidsanson.com/Interpres.app.zip)~~

~~(Interpres.app is GUI wrapper around Words, written by Erik Mendoza. The official version, which does not work with Lion, is available [here](https://sites.google.com/site/erikandremendoza/).)~~
