    The new official Pandoc installer for OS X only works on 10.6 and 10.7. I've compiled an [unofficial installer](http://files.davidsanson.com/pandoc-1.8.2_ppc_installer.dmg) that works on 10.5.

For a long time, the only way to install [Pandoc] on a Mac was to first install the [Haskell Platform] and then build from source by executing 

~~~{.sh}

$ cabal install pandoc

~~~

from the command line.

Happily, there is now a [binary installer package] available. It works for OS X 10.6 and 10.7. It does not work for OS X 10.5.

So [here] is an unofficial [10.5 PPC Pandoc Installer]. The binary it installs is a PPC binary. It should work on both PPC machines running 10.5 and (with some performance penalty) on Intel machines running 10.5 via [Rosetta]. Apparently it does not work on 10.4 or 10.3.
