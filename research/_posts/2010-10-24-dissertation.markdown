> In my dissertation, I tried to make sense of the view that the
> facts that constitute reality---the facts about what there is, and
> what properties things instantiate---are temporary facts. But I don't
> that's quite how I put it at the time. The core of the dissertation is
> the argument in "Once Present, Now Past". It also contains
> a critical discussion of one interpretation of the view Michael Tooley defends
> in *Time, Tense, and Causation* (1997). On that interpretation, Tooley's
> view---that we can understand temporary facts only by supposing that
> reality is fundamentally relative to times---ends up looking a lot like
> the "external relativism" that Kit Fine describes in "Tense and Reality"
> (2005).
