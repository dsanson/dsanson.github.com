> If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality
> changes, the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that
> work unless it is no longer real. This tells against
> *the moving now* theory, *the growing block* theory, and any form
> of *presentism* that attempts to understand the past in terms of the
> present, including *tensed properties presentism* and
> *tensed facts presentism*. It tells in favor of
> *priorian presentism*, properly understood.
