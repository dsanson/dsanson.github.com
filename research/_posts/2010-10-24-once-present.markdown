"[Once Present, Now Past](/research/oncepresent.pdf)," under review.

> If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality
> changes, the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that
> work unless it is no longer real. This tells against
> *The Moving Now* theory, *The Growing Block* theory, and any form
> of *Presentism* that attempts to understand the past in terms of the
> present, including *Tensed Properties Presentism* and
> *Tensed Facts Presentism*. It tells in favor of
> *Priorian Presentism*, properly understood.
