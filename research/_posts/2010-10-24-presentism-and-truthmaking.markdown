(with [Ben Caplan](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/)),
promised to *Philosophy Compass*.

> Three plausible views---Presentism, Truthmaking, and
> Independence---form an inconsistent triad. By Presentism, all being
> is present being. By Truthmaking, all truth supervenes on, and is
> explained in terms of, being. By Independence, some past
> truths do not supervene on, or are not explained in terms of,
> present being. We survey and assess some responses to this.
