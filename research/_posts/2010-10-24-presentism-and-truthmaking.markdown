> Three plausible views---Presentism, Truthmaking, and
> Independence---form an inconsistent triad. By Presentism, all being
> is present being. By Truthmaking, all truth supervenes on being. By 
> Independence, some past
> truths do not supervene on
> present being. Presentists must reject either Truthmaking or
> Independence. We survey and assess various attempts
> to do so.
