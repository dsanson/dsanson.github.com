> Presentists cannot account for facts about how things once were by
> treating them as special facts about how things now are. For
> example, the truth of the proposition that Arnold was pale depends
> not on the properties that Arnold presently has---like the property
> *having been pale*---but rather on the properties that Arnold once
> had---like the property *being pale*. For Presentists, tensed talk
> should be understood as a device for pointing beyond reality:
> beyond what is and how things are, to what was and how things
> were.
