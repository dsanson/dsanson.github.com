"What's a World?" *draft will be posted soon*

> Possible worlds are not properties that the cosmos could have had.
> Nor are they alternate cosmoi---counterparts of the cosmos we
> inhabit. Possible worlds are maximal possibilities, and
> possibilities are neither individuals nor properties;
> Possibilities, and hence possible worlds, are complex entities
> involving both individuals and properties: perhaps possibly true
> maximal propositions, perhaps possibly existing maximal facts.
