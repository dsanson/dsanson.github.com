> Possible worlds are maximal possibilities. But what kind of thing *is* a maximal possibility? Not a maximal individual: there are more maximal possibilities than there are maximal individuals, because each maximal individual could have any one of several maximal properties. And not a maximal property: there are more maximal possibilities than there are maximal properties, because each maximal property could be had by any one of many possible maximal individuals. So if you like your worlds concrete, you should say that they are maximal facts, and if you like your worlds abstract, you should say that they are maximal propositions.
