"Worlds Enough for Junk", under revision.

> The possibility of Junk is the possibility that everything is a proper
> part of something else. Just as we might imagine that there are no
> simples---that everything *has* a proper part, all the way down---we
> might imagine that there are no caps---that everything *is* a proper
> part, all the way up. This putative possibility is hard to
> accommodate within a Lewisian modal framework. For Lewis, every
> possibility involves the existence of a possible world, and a possible
> world is, by definition, the mereological sum of everything that
> exists within that possibility. But the Lewisian can accommodate Junk,
> if she wishes, by allowing parts of possible worlds to represent
> complete possibilities.
