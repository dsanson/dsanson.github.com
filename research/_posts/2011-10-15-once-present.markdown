> If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality changes,
> the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that work unless
> it is no longer real. This tells against the *Moving Now Theory*, the
> *Growing Block Theory*, and any form of *Presentism* that attempts to
> understand the past in terms of the present, including *Tensed
> Properties Presentism* and *Tensed Facts Presentism*. It tells in
> favor of a form *Presentism* that allows us to appeal to unreal past
> facts. I suggest that *Priorian Presentism*, conjoined with a certain
> way of understanding the role played by tense operators, is one such
> view.
