"[Worlds Enough for Junk](http://files.davidsanson.com/research/worlds-enough-for-junk.pdf)," under revision.

> The possibility of *Junk* is the possibility that something exists and
> everything is a proper part. Just as we might imagine that there are
> no simples---that everything *has* a proper part, all the way
> down---we might imagine that there are no caps---that everything *is*
> a proper part, all the way up. It is not obvious that this apparent
> possibility can be accommodated within a Lewisian modal framework. For
> Lewis, every possibility involves the existence of a possible world,
> and a possible world is just is a maximal sum, and so a cap. But the
> Lewisian can accommodate Junk, if she wishes, by allowing that parts
> of possible worlds collectively represent complete possibilities.
