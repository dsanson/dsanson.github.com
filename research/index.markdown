# Work in Progress

-   "[Once Present, Now Past](/research/oncepresent.pdf)", draft,
    updated 10-13-2010.

    -   If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality
        changes, the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that
        work unless it is no longer any part of reality. This tells against
        *The Moving Now* theory, *The Growing Block* theory, and any form
        of Presentism that attempts to build past facts into the present,
        including *Priorian Presentism*, as it is standardly interpreted.
        It tells in favor of *Hypothetical Priorian Presentism*, and,
        ultimately, in favor of *Meinonigan Presentism*.

-   "[Presentism and Truthmaking](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/presentism_and_truthmaking.pdf)"
    (with [Ben Caplan](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/)),
    promised to *Philosophy Compass*.

    -   A brief overview of the Truthmaking Problem for Presentism and
        possible solutions to it.

# Papers

-   "[The Way Things Were](/research/WayThingsWere.pdf)" (with
    [Ben Caplan](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/)),
    *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research* (81.1) 2010: 24-39.

    -   An argument that Presentists cannot account for facts about how
        things once were by treating them as special facts about how things
        now are. For example, we argue that the truth of the proposition
        that Arnold was pale depends not on the properties that Arnold
        presently instantiates---like the property of having been
        pale---but rather on the properties that Arnold once
        instantiated---like the property of being pale. We suggest that,
        for Presentists, tensed talk should be understood as a device for
        pointing beyond reality: beyond what is and how things are, to what
        was and how things were.

-   "[The Early Arabic Liar](/research/ArabicLiar.pdf)" (with [Ahmed Alwishah](http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/alwishah/index.asp)), *Vivarium* (47:1) 2009: 97-127.

    -   An analysis of the earliest discussions of the Liar Paradox in
        the Medieval Arabic tradition, including the earliest known text in
        any tradition to blame the paradox on self-reference. English
        translations of the main texts are included.

# Dissertation

- *[Being and Time: The Metaphysics of Past and Future in a Dynamic World](/research/dissertation.pdf)*, UCLA, 2005

    + A dissertation that tries to make sense of the view that the fundamental metaphysical facts---the facts about what there is, and what properties things instantiate---are tensed or dynamic facts.
