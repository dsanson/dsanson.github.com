# Work in Progress

-   "[Once Present, Now Past](/research/oncepresent.pdf)," under review.

    -   If reality is temporary, then reality changes, and if reality
        changes, the past has explanatory work to do, and it cannot do that
        work unless it is no longer real. This tells against
        *The Moving Now* theory, *The Growing Block* theory, and any form
        of *Presentism* that attempts to understand the past in terms of the
        present, including *Tensed Properties Presentism* and
        *Tensed Facts Presentism*. It tells in favor of
        *Priorian Presentism*, properly understood.

-   "[Presentism and Truthmaking](/research/presentism-and-truthmaking.pdf)"
    (with [Ben Caplan](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/)),
    promised to *Philosophy Compass*.

    -   Three plausible views---Presentism, Truthmaking, and
        Independence---form an inconsistent triad. By Presentism, all being
        is present being. By Truthmaking, all truth supervenes on, and is
        explained in terms of, present being. By Independence, some past
        truths do not supervene on, or are not explained in terms of,
        present being. We survey and assess some responses to this.

# Papers

-   "[The Way Things Were](/research/WayThingsWere.pdf)" (with
    [Ben Caplan](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/caplan16/)),
    *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research* (81.1) 2010: 24-39.

    -   An argument that Presentists cannot account for facts about how
        things once were by treating them as special facts about how things
        now are. For example, we argue that the truth of the proposition
        that Arnold was pale depends not on the properties that Arnold
        presently instantiates---like the property of having been
        pale---but rather on the properties that Arnold once
        instantiated---like the property of being pale. We suggest that,
        for Presentists, tensed talk should be understood as a device for
        pointing beyond reality: beyond what is and how things are, to what
        was and how things were.

-   "[The Early Arabic Liar](/research/ArabicLiar.pdf)" (with [Ahmed Alwishah](http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/alwishah/index.asp)), *Vivarium* (47:1) 2009: 97-127.

    -   An analysis of the earliest discussions of the Liar Paradox in
        the Medieval Arabic tradition, including the earliest known text in
        any tradition to blame the paradox on self-reference. English
        translations of the main texts are included.

# Dissertation

-   *[Being and Time: The Metaphysics of Past and Future in a Dynamic World](/research/dissertation.pdf)*,
    UCLA, 2005.

    -   In my dissertation, I tried to make sense of the view that the
        facts that constitute reality---the facts about what there is, and
        what properties things instantiate---are temporary facts.
