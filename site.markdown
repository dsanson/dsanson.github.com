## Site design

The design of this site is my own. But I began by taking a careful look at [Mark Reid's site](http://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name), and the bones of this site's design continue to owe a fair bit to his design.

## Nuts and Bolts

This site is generated by

-   [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (a lightweight CMS)

I've hacked my copy of Jekyll so that it can use [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for markdown to html conversion; [pandoc-ruby](http://github.com/alphabetum/pandoc-ruby) made that easy.

The site makes use of several useful scripts and services:

-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) manages comments.
-   [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) makes adding occasional bits of javascript-powered functionality easy
-   [html5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) makes older versions of Internet Explorer recognize HTML5 elements.
-   [H2VX Contacts Conversion Service](http://h2vx.com/vcf/) converts the hcard on the index page to a downloadable vcard.
-   [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) provides avatars for commenters and the image on my [about me](/me) page.
-   I use the [COinS Generator](http://generator.ocoins.info/) to generate COinS metadata for papers on my research paper.
-   The 'bored?' link at the bottom of each page is provided by [Kick ass](http://erkie.github.com/).

The site is hosted on

-   [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/),

which is an inexpensive pay-as-you-go bare-bones web host. I've been happy with it so far.

The site is also available on [Github](http://github.com/). You can browse the [source](http://github.com/dsanson/dsanson.github.com) used by Jekyll to generate the site (and fork it if you like!). Github also automatically generates a [mirror](http://dsanson.github.com) of the site.

## Other software I use or recommend

### For Writing

-   [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) (generates HTML, LaTeX, PDF, ODT, RTF, EPUB, s5, Slidy, DocBook, ConTeXt, Texinfo, man, reStructuredText, MediaWiki documents from [extended](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown-vs.standard-markdown) [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents)
-   [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) (simple text notes made simple)
-   [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) (a powerful text editor)
-	[MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) (a more powerful text editor with a steeper learning curve)
-   [git](http://git.or.cz/) (version control software: if you write in plain-text, figuring this out is worth it)

### For Research

-   [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) (best way to gather bibliographic information and PDFs from websites)
-   [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) (best software I've found to catalog bibliographic information and PDFs)
-   [Zot2Bib](http://mackerron.com/zot2bib/) (best way to get bibliographic information from websites into BibDesk)
-   [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) (a very nice PDF viewer and annotator)

### For Everything

-   [Quicksilver](http://github.com/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy) (an OSX application launcher and much much more)
-   [SimpleNote](http://simplenoteapp.com/) (simple text notes made simple on iOS; syncs with Notational Velocity)
-   [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) (less simple notes and not quite as simple, syncs with everything)
-   [Dropbox](https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTg1MzM4OQ) (sharing files between computers made si
mple)
