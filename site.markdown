## Site design

The design of this site is my own. But I began by taking a careful look at [Mark Reid's site](http://github.com/mreid/mark.reid.name), and the bones of this site's design continue to owe a fair bit to his design.

## Nuts and Bolts

This site is generated by

-   [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (a lightweight CMS)

Actually, unless you are reading this at [http://dsanson.github.com](http://dsanson.github.com), it was generated using 

-   [My fork of Jekyll](https://github.com/dsanson/jekyll/tree/pandoc-ruby), 

which has been modified to use [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for markdown to html conversion. [pandoc-ruby](http://github.com/alphabetum/pandoc-ruby) made that easy.

The site makes use of several useful scripts and services:

-   [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) manages comments.
-   [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) makes adding occasional bits of javascript-powered functionality easy
-   [html5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/) makes older versions of Internet Explorer recognize HTML5 elements.
-   [H2VX Contacts Conversion Service](http://h2vx.com/vcf/) converts the hcard on the index page to a downloadable vcard.
-   [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) provides avatars for commenters and the image on my [about me](/me) page.
-   I use the [COinS Generator](http://generator.ocoins.info/) to generate COinS metadata for papers on my research page.
-   The 'bored?' link at the bottom of each page is provided by [Kick ass](http://erkie.github.com/).

The site is hosted on

-   [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/),

an inexpensive pay-as-you-go bare-bones web host. I end up paying ~$9 a year for domain registration and >50Â¢ a month for storage and bandwidth. I've been happy with them so far. To keep that price low, large files (like PDFs) are hosted via

-	[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) 

To make the Dropbox URLs look better, I use

-   [Dropbprox](http://code.google.com/p/dropbprox/)

A [mirror of the site](http://dsanson.github.com) is also available via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). You can browse the [source](http://github.com/dsanson/dsanson.github.com) used by Jekyll to generate the site (and fork it if you like!).

If I were starting over today, I would probably just host the site on Github. The hosting is free, and they now support [custom domains](http://pages.github.com/#custom_domains). So then my only cost would be domain registration and DNS.
